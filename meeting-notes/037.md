# Ream Meeting #37 Recap

## Overview

This was a smaller team call with Jun, Kayden, Varun, Shariq, and Dimitris participating. The meeting focused on development updates and progress toward the September 15th milestone. Notable absences included O (on vacation) and Partha (previous call conflict). The team discussed various implementation work across different components, with some concerns about potential delays to the upcoming devnet milestone due to spec confirmation bottlenecks.

## Development Progress

### CLI and PQ Signature Implementation

- **Private Key CLI**: Shariq completed implementation of CLI for creating private key specs with P256K private keys, which has been merged
- **Modular Hash Signature Scheme**: Shariq is working on creating a modular, swappable PQ signature scheme system with PR expected soon
- **Code Review**: Shariq reviewed Jihoon's PR, noting some comment inconsistencies that need addressing

### Database Integration

- **Database Setup**: Varun merged PR setting up database and required tables in Lean chain
- **Integration Hold**: Varun is waiting for O's refactoring PR to merge before continuing with database integration work

### Infrastructure and Tooling

- **Kurtosis Research**: Kayden conducted research into kurtosis and plans to create a HackMD documentation file
- **Small PRs**: Kayden implemented endpoint additions and database refactoring to support Varun's upcoming work

### Consensus and Explorer

- **Consensus Specs**: Jun spent time reading specs and participating in Friday calls with O and Gajinder from Zeam team regarding consensus specifications
- **PQ DevNet Specs**: O's PR covers most changes needed for pqdevnet spec accuracy and is ready for merge
- **Explorer Development**: Jun added endpoints for explorer app similar to Dora in Beacon Chain, with potential demo planned for next interop call

### zkVM Implementations

- **OpenVM Implementation**: Dimitris completed OpenVM implementation for single attestation, mimicking work done by Utsav and Unnawut in other repos
- **Cycle Count Challenges**: OpenVM cycle count implementation requires complex metrics construction and flame graphs rather than simple function calls
- **Multi-zkVM Comparison**: Planning to aggregate results from multiple zkVM implementations (potentially 5-6 different ones) for comparative analysis

## Next Steps

- **Shariq**: Finalize modular hash signature scheme PR and continue code reviews
- **Varun**: Wait for Etherspot merge, then integrate database with Lean chain
- **Kayden**: Create HackMD documentation for kurtosis research and follow up on HackMD access with O
- **Jun**: Complete explorer app demo preparation and continue consensus spec coordination
- **Dimitris**: Finish OpenVM cycle count implementation and coordinate repository structure for zkVM implementations
