# Ream Meeting #39 Recap

## Overview

The devnet0 specs have been successfully ported to Ream thanks to collaborative review efforts. Key infrastructure improvements included keystore implementation, genesis generator integration, and P2P networking enhancements. The team addressed critical finalization issues that were causing consensus problems, while also making significant strides in zkVM benchmarking across multiple platforms. Discussions around metrics integration with the PQ interop initiative gained momentum, and the team began planning the transition from benchmarking to actual zkVM integration with the Ream client.

## Development Progress

### Core Infrastructure
- **Devnet0 Integration**: Unnawut completed porting devnet0 specs to Ream with extensive review support from Jun and Kolby
- **Keystore Implementation**: Partha completed the keystore PR with Jun's collaboration and review
- **Genesis Generator**: Jun integrated Genesis generator outputs into the Ream codebase, enabling consumption of trusted peers and validator lists with node ID flags

### Networking and Consensus
- **Local P2P Devnet**: Jun created local p2p devnet, a Docker Compose script running four nodes locally with Ream Docker images, successfully observing finalization events
- **P2P Issues**: Jun identified and resolved several P2P networking issues, with some still pending
- **Finalization Bug Fix**: Jun discovered and resolved critical performance issues in DBPR where justification validator calculations were taking 0.3 seconds, preventing proper block finalization within the one-second window
- **Self-Dialing Prevention**: Varun implemented a fix preventing Ream nodes from dialing themselves

### Post-Quantum and Metrics
- **Hash Signature Modularity**: Shariq made hash signatures modular with cargo features, replacing hardcoded lifetime values and enabling custom scheme integration
- **Metrics Initiative**: Team began planning metrics integration with PQ interop, with Shariq preparing to bootstrap basic metrics and coordinate with Guillaume and Katya

### zkVM Benchmarking
- **Jolt Integration**: Utsav successfully executed transition functions in Jolt, observing faster execution than SP1 but noting complexity in benchmarking due to 64-bit architecture differences
- **OpenVM Research**: Dmitris investigated OpenVM instruction cycle counting but encountered challenges getting comprehensive answers from the OpenVM team
- **Three-Slot Finality**: Dmitris completed documentation review of 3-slot finality consensus mechanisms

### Quality and Documentation
- **Code Review Standards**: Partha raised PR for Copilot review integration, pending team consensus
- **Workflow Updates**: Utsav identified and offered to fix outdated GitHub workflows

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Finalize Q3 documentation and structures, catch up on EPF fellowship inquiries
- **Jun**: Bootstrap metrics folder with basic Ream metrics, coordinate with Guillaume on metrics standardization
- **Shariq**: Create comprehensive metrics tracking document, initiate discussions with Guillaume, present findings to PQ interop call
- **Varun**: Implement Jun's DB PR fixes, coordinate with Jun on next development priorities
- **Utsav**: Complete Jolt benchmarking with time-based comparisons, decide between unified zkVM platform or direct Lean integration approach
- **Dmitris**: Determine optimal zkVM selection strategy, explore execution time measurement for OpenVM integration
- **Partha**: Address additional keystore tasks, follow up on team consensus for Copilot integration
- **Katya**: Review existing Ream metrics, prepare metrics discussion for tomorrow's PQ interop call
