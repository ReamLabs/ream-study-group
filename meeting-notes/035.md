# Ream Meeting #35 Recap

## Overview

The team made solid progress across multiple fronts in preparation for the PQ devnet. Key developments included networking improvements, post-quantum cryptography integration, and zkVM implementations. The devnet timeline was adjusted to mid-September to allow both Ream and Zeam more time to complete their implementations. The team also reverted back to secp256k1 signatures, as the switch to ed25519 would require extensive breaking changes. Several important specification clarifications were raised regarding fork digests and message ID calculations that will be addressed in upcoming PRs.

## Development Progress

### Networking & P2P Infrastructure
- **Request-Response Implementation**: Kolby successfully ported the existing beacon chain request-response infrastructure to work with Lean, with plans to implement initial connection handling from the devnet0 spec
- **Gossip Implementation**: Kayden completed broadcast and receive functionality for gossipsub and is now working on Docker compose files for pqdevnet and CI workflow for Docker image builds
- **Multi-node devnet**: Jun fixed gossipsub issues and successfully achieved consensus using P2P in a local multi-node devnet setup with four different nodes

### Post-Quantum Cryptography
- **Core Implementation**: Shariq initialized the post-quantum crypto crate with hash sig functionality, enabling key generation, private key signing, and message signing capabilities
- **Signature Parameters**: Unnawut investigated Benedikt's parameters generator and determined the signature size will be 3100 bytes, with plans to verify SSZ library compatibility
- **CLI Wrapper Clarification**: Mercy raised questions about the Genesis generator integration approach, with the team deciding to clarify responsibilities in the next PQ interop call

### zkVM Development
- **Multiple Implementation Progress**: Utsav reported progress on guest profiling for Jolt and beacon state transition functions across multiple zkVMs including SP1, Jolt, Pico, and OpenVM
- **OpenVM Integration**: Dimitris resolved technical issues and successfully got OpenVM running, able to read attestations and compute proofs, though full proof generation requires optimization for laptop constraints
- **RPC Development**: Varun continued work on peer RPC implementation with final review comments being addressed

### API & Infrastructure
- **Beacon API**: Jay submitted two PRs with one merged and another pending review, while seeking clarification on cache database integration
- **Specifications Work**: Unnawut focused on Lean specs reviews and addressed comments, with initial Python specs work

## Next Steps

- **Kolby**: Implement initial connection handling specified in devnet0 spec
- **Kayden**: Complete Docker compose file for Lean devnet and finish CI workflow for GitHub
- **Shariq**: Discuss account manager implementation with Jun and Partha, create issues for remaining post-quantum work
- **Varun**: Resolve final RPC comments and coordinate with Kolby on next implementation priorities
- **Utsav**: Update consumable codebase for Jolt guest profiling and develop test vectors for new state
- **Unnawut**: Review STF specs, investigate kurtosis requirements, and verify SSZ library compatibility for 3100-byte signatures
- **Jun**: Submit PR for fork digest and message ID calculation improvements to Lean specs
- **Dimitris**: Optimize OpenVM code, add generalization features, and prepare for PQ devnet migration
- **Jay**: Resolve cache database questions with Varun and continue Beacon API implementation
- **Mercy**: Clarify genesis generator integration responsibilities in next PQ interop call
