# Ream Meeting #15 Recap

## Overview

Key updates included Varun's initial PR for the Beacon API, which he proposed breaking into subtasks due to its complexity. Kolby reported progress on the P2P stack and noted a potential contributor's interest. Kayden successfully passed the last test for epoch processing and is now focusing on fork choice functions. Unnawut launched the beamroadmap.org website, mentioned an out-of-memory issue with SSZ for validator registry limits that Vid discovered, and emphasized the need for byte streaming with SSE encoding. Vid faced challenges with message reception in the Gossipsub implementation.

The team discussed API prioritization, with Varun advocating for state-related APIs. Jihoon Song suggested a two-approval process for substantial PRs. Action items were assigned to specific team members, including Kolby creating sub-issues for the Beacon API and reviewing Varun's work, while others focused on debugging, continuing API development, and implementing necessary features.

## Project Updates

- Varun Doshi created a PR for Beacon API, though it's only a starting point with the Genesis endpoint working
- Varun suggested breaking down the Beacon API task into subtasks as it's more complex than expected
- Kolby worked on request-response domain of P2P stack, completed SSC snappy compression
- Kolby mentioned a potential contributor interested in working on the P2P code
- Kayden implemented macros and tests for sanity block and slots, got the last test passing for epoch processing
- Kayden is now working on implementing fork choice functions, macros, and tests
- Unnawut launched the Beam roadmap website, which received good reception
- Vid discovered an out-of-memory issue related to validator registry limits (registry limit is 2^40, ~1 billion validators)
  - Need to implement byte streaming for SSZ encoding as `ssz_rs` library doesn't support optimization
- Vid worked on Gossipsub implementation but is having issues receiving messages on the Beacon block topic

## API Implementation Discussion

- Discussion about which Beacon API endpoints should be implemented
- Varun suggested at least building out most state-related APIs
- Kolby mentioned implementing whatever helps test the P2P stack and gossip sub functionality
- Team has time to develop experience with the implementation before the Beam chain spec is released
- Varun requested Kolby to create sub-issues for the Beacon API implementation based on priorities

## PR Review Process

- Jihoon Song suggested requiring at least two approvals for each PR
- Kolby proposed that only substantial PRs (800-1000+ lines) should need two reviews
- Discussed how to determine which PRs need more reviews - could be based on PR author's request or reviewer's comfort level
- The discussion concluded by sticking to 1 approval as it is a prototype codebase. The criteria will reconsidered for production codebase.

## Action items

Kolby
- Create sub-issues for the Beacon API implementation with priorities
- Review Varun's PR for Beacon API and provide suggestions
- Work on completing the minimal PR for P2P implementation
- Create issues for the potential contributor interested in P2P code

Varun
- Incorporate Kolby's suggestions into the Beacon API PR
- Work on building out state-related APIs

Vid
- Debug why messages are not being received on the Beacon block topic in Gossipsub implementation

Kayden
- Continue implementing fork choice functions, macros, and tests

Unnawut
- Figure out a way to implement bytes streaming for the SSZ encoding
