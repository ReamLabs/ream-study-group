# Ream Meeting #50 Recap

## Overview

The team discussed progress across infrastructure improvements and signature implementation. Key developments included enhanced error handling for better node reliability, ongoing work integrating leanSig types, and completion of production signature test vectors.

Several Beacon API endpoints were merged and P2P issues were resolved. Observations were raised about logging quality and network stability, noting that duplicate error messages complicate debugging and that better observability around attestation monitoring would help diagnose finality issues more effectively. The team discussed potential improvements including metrics dashboards and clearer log messages.

## Development Progress

### Core Infrastructure

- **Error Handling**: Kolby fixed a critical issue where service failures were causing confusion - now if any service dies, the entire node stops gracefully
- **Code Review**: Kolby spent significant time reviewing PRs this week

### Signature Implementation

- **Lean Multisig**: Kayden implemented signing functionality and updated DevNet 2 containers (Kayden)
- **Lean Sig Integration**: Shariq has been integrating leanSig types from Lean VM and expects to have a PR ready today for potential devnet-2 deployment
- **Production Signatures**: Unnawut completed PR for production signatures in Lean Spec with test vectors, expecting to merge within today or tomorrow after final feedback

### Beacon API & P2P

- **Beacon API Endpoints**: Mihir merged approximately five Beacon API endpoints from his work plus several from other contributors
- **P2P Fixes**: Mihir resolved attestation subnet subscription issues

### EPF & zkVM Work

- **pqdevnet0 Progress**: Utsav successfully ran four nodes locally with working gossip networks and finality, currently rebasing to master branch
- **zkVM Compatibility**: Dimitris is focusing on maintaining compatibility with zkVM updates and investigating Lean Multisig performance issues within zkVM

### Fork & Testing

- **Time Management Tests**: Derek completed and merged all time management tests
- **Fulu Fork Logic**: Derek started implementing the Fulu fork logic upgrade and response trunk limits

### DevNet Operations & Monitoring

- **Log Quality Issues**: Katya identified duplicate error messages in logs making debugging difficult, particularly around attestation and block publishing
- **Finality Loss Investigation**: devnet1 lost finality when Zeam and Qlean ran out of memory, leaving only Ream and Lantern running - highlighting need for better attestation monitoring
- **Observability Improvements**: Team discussed adding metrics for attestation targets and counts to improve debugging in Grafana

## Next Steps

- **Kolby**: Investigate and potentially fix duplicate error log messages
- **Kayden**: Complete signature aggregator precursor implementation
- **Shariq**: Submit PR for leanSig type integration and discuss devnet-2 plans in tomorrow's meeting
- **Varun**: Resume pending tasks after recovering from illness
- **Unnawut**: Merge production signatures PR, then integrate test vectors with production signatures into Ream
- **Mihir**: Complete remaining Beacon API endpoint and investigate outstanding issue
- **Utsav**: Complete rebase to master branch within two days and get proofs running with working gossip and verification
- **Derek**: Complete Fulu fork logic upgrade and make progress on response trunk limits implementation
- **Dmitry**: Catch up with Utsav's EPF updates, investigate leanMultisig performance in zkVM
- **Ekaterina**: Share detailed feedback and logs in Ream chat for duplicate errors and finality issues, investigate Lantern logs
