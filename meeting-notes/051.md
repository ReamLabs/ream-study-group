# Ream Meeting #51 Recap

## Overview

The team convened to discuss progress on the project, focusing on signature aggregation, devnet stability, and upcoming features for devnet-2. Recent accomplishments include the successful merging of the production signature test vectors into leanSpec with automated vector generation, and investigation of reported issues with the lean-quickstart that suspected to be infrastructure-related rather than Ream-specific.

The team discussed syncing implementation plans for devnet-2, with deliberate decisions around maintaining diversity in syncing logic across clients. Positive feedback was provided on Ream's stability on devnet-1, with several new metrics proposed for monitoring, including sync status, version info, and aggregation metrics. Development work continues on signature aggregation, peer tracking, Fulu fork upgrades (for the beacon client), and zkVM integration.

## Development Progress

### Signature Aggregation and Testing

- **leanSig test/production signatures**: Unnawut successfully merged the production/test signature flag into leanSpec, which now automatically generates test vectors through GitHub build jobs, eliminating the need for manual command execution
- **Aggregation Logic**: Kayden continued implementing signature aggregator precursor logic
- **Spec Integration**: Shariq began porting the aggregated signature PR from leanSpec into Ream

### Devnet Stability and Monitoring

- **Devnet-1 Stability**: Katya confirmed Ream is running stably on devnet-1 with no observed issues
- **Peer Metrics**: Varun implemented peer tracking metrics in Ream, enabling monitoring of total peers, connections, and disconnections
- **New Metrics Proposals**: Katya proposed adding sync status metrics, version info metrics, reorg tracking, finalization failure reporting, and aggregation metrics (number of signatures, aggregation time)

### lean-quickstart Investigation

- **Infrastructure Issues**: Unnawut investigated reported lean-quickstart issues with Ream and determined they are likely infrastructure-related rather than Ream-specific
- **Geographic Distribution**: Discovered that three nodes are located in Germany while one (Ream's) is in Finland, potentially contributing to observed delays
- **Ansible Logging**: Identified that Ansible provides detailed task timing logs for future debugging

### Fork and Protocol Updates

- **Block Production**: Varun updated Ream's block production logic to align with recent spec changes
- **Fulu Fork (beacon client)**: Derek worked on upgrading to Fulu fork logic and implementing response chunks for the fork
- **zkVM Integration**: Dimitris is integrating ERE (self-updating zkVM tool) to replace manual zkVM integration, while Utsav refactors code for devnet-1

### Syncing and Reorg Handling

- **Devnet-2 Features**: Team confirmed syncing will be implemented for devnet-2
- **Reorg Support**: Short-term reorg handling will be implemented for devnet-2

### Finalization Concerns

- **Cross-Client Issues**: Katya observed that when Zeam fails, all clients lose finality despite three stable clients remaining, which warrants further investigation

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Schedule call with Anshal to review signature aggregation specs; update leanroadmap.org
- **Kayden**: Continue implementing signature aggregator precursor logic
- **Kolby**: Review PRs; work on syncing implementation for devnet-2
- **Varun**: Continue monitoring peer metrics and devnet stability
- **Shariq**: Complete porting of aggregated signature PR from leanSpec to Ream
- **Dimitris**: Complete ERE integration for devnet-0 prototype
- **Utsav**: Finish refactoring code for devnet-1
- **Derek**: Complete beacon state transition implementation for Fulu fork logic
- **Katya**: Open draft PR for sync metrics and reorg metrics; investigate finalization issues when clients go offline; implement finalization failure reporting metric
