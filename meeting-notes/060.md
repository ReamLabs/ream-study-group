# Ream Meeting #60 Recap

## Overview

The team discussed progress on devnet-3 interop, sync improvements, and testing infrastructure. Key highlights include successful interop with all available clients on devnet-3, a new regression testing CI pipeline, and ongoing work on aggregation broadcasting. Two team members are also preparing for an upcoming talk at EthCC on April 1st.

## Development Progress

### Testing & CI Infrastructure

- **Regression Testing CI**: Kolby added a new CI test that runs two nodes - a known good commit and the PR's code—to verify finalization and catch regressions before merging. This addresses at least five past incidents where breaking changes were shipped without detection.
- **Flaky CI Investigation**: Kolby and Shariq are investigating flaky test CI for devnet-3. Tests pass locally but fail intermittently in CI, reducing confidence in the test suite.

### Syncer Improvements

- **Syncer Hardening**: Kolby opened a draft PR to harden the syncer and fix an issue where pending blocks were not being pruned during sync. Additionally, edge cases during the transition from backfill sync to head sync—where the node could get stuck oscillating—have been resolved.
- **Syncer Tie-Breaking**: Shariq improved the syncer's peer tally logic so that in tie scenarios (e.g., two peers reporting slot 50 and two reporting slot 51), the highest slot is now chosen instead of selecting randomly.
- **Benchmarks & Configuration**: Kolby added benchmarks and configurations to support A/B testing of syncer changes.

### devnet-3 Interop

- **Interop Status**: Shariq worked through spec compliance fixes to resolve finalization failures on devnet-3. Ream is now interoperating with all available clients on devnet-3, including a recently confirmed interop with Qlean.

### Aggregation & Networking

- **Aggregation Broadcast PR**: Kayden is working on the aggregation broadcast PR, including adding database tables for new fields on the store struct introduced in devnet-3. Expected to be ready within the next couple of days.

### Fork Choice Testing

- **Fork Choice Test Refactor**: Derek continued work on splitting up fork choice tests, bundling it with a larger spec update/optimization into a single issue. He collaborated with Kayden earlier in the week on the best approach.

### Community

- **ECC Talk**: Kayden is preparing a talk at EthCC scheduled for April 1st. Details and the link will be shared in the chat.

## Next Steps

- **Kolby**: Finalize and merge the syncer hardening PR; continue investigating flaky CI issues.
- **Shariq**: Continue running devnet-3 interop against clients and maintaining node stability.
- **Kayden**: Complete the aggregation broadcast PR; continue preparing for the ECC talk on April 1st.
- **Derek**: Make further progress on the fork choice test refactor and spec optimization.
