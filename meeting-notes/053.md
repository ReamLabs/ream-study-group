# Ream Meeting #53 Recap

## Overview

The team reconvened for their first meeting of the new year, returning from the holiday break. The focus was on improving client stability, addressing database and memory issues, advancing leanSig specification testing, and preparing for the next devnet deployment. Key areas of progress included database optimization, signature verification testing, devnet monitoring improvements, and planning for ERE implementation. The team also discussed syncing logic implementation and metrics standardization to better support multi-client devnet operations.

## Development Progress

### Client Optimization and Database Management

- **Memory and Storage Improvements**: Kolby addressed critical database issues by implementing state pruning to cap memory usage, which had previously reached 160 gigabytes. The system now prunes states older than 128 slots and includes statistics tracking that prints sorted tables every 15 slots to monitor database storage.
- **Logging Improvements**: Kolby removed noisy logs that were causing issues during devnet operations.

### leanSig Development and Testing

- **Signature Verification**: Shariq implemented spec tests for verifying signatures, though all tests currently fail due to signature verification issues with Python-generated keys. New keys are being generated after a fix on the leanSpec side.
- **Aggregation Code**: Shariq is working on adding signature aggregation from leanSpec and collaborated with Kayden to plan PR structure and create associated issues.
- **Signature Aggregator**: Kayden implemented and merged the signature aggregator precursor PR and added devnet-2 tests to CI and Makefile.
- **Test Key Generation**: Unnawut is generating new leanSig test keys, a process taking approximately 2 days to complete. He also reviewed the aggregation improvements PR and is revising the leanroadmap.org website with updated information.

### Devnet Operations and Monitoring

- **Devnet Testing**: Katya ran devnets during the holidays and reported that Ream performs well aside from database issues. A new devnet is planned pending updates from other clients to test Kolby's database fixes.
- **Metrics Implementation**: Discussion on implementing attestation target metrics for attestation producers to track whether validators are attesting to the same targets, which is crucial for finalization. Syncing metrics will be moved to a separate PR with two main statuses: at the head or syncing to the head.
- **Request/Response Issues**: Investigation revealed that attestations sometimes arrive before blocks, causing clients to request target blocks that haven't yet propagated, particularly at devnet startup.
- **Grafana Setup**: Katya is working with the EF DevOps team to set up Grafana for shared team monitoring, expected to be delivered in one to two weeks.

### Syncing Implementation

- **Syncing Logic**: Kolby is developing syncing functionality. The implementation will handle both initial syncing when joining the network and resyncing if the node falls out of sync, using block requests to walk the chain forward until gossip can maintain synchronization.

### ERE and Other Work

- **ERE Testing**: D Mitsios completed ERE testing on the previous prototype and is waiting to refactor code from devnet-0 to devnet-1. The team decided this is not currently a priority, allowing work to proceed at a comfortable pace.
- **PeerDAS Research**: Kayden conducted research into PeerDAS in preparation for future implementation work and is preparing a talk submission.

### New Participant

- **New Participant Introduction**: Abhivansh joined the call for the first time, having been contributing to Ream by working on beacon API implementations. Kolby provided guidance on implementing spec updates by comparing current Petra implementation with Osaka specs and updating functions accordingly.

## Next Steps

- **Kolby**: Continue working on syncing code to handle nodes starting after genesis
- **Shariq**: Complete signature verification spec test PR once key generation issues are resolved, continue implementing signature aggregation from leanSpec
- **Kayden**: Continue PeerDAS research and work on talk preparation
- **Unnawut**: Complete leanroadmap.org revision, finish generating new leanSig test keys
- **Katya**: Launch new devnet to test database improvements, implement attestation target metrics, deliver Grafana setup for team monitoring in 1-2 weeks, create separate PR for syncing metrics
- **Dimitris**: Refactor code from devnet-0 to devnet-1 and implement ERE
- **Abhivansh**: Continue work on PeerDAS implementation from spec, ask questions in Telegram channel as needed
