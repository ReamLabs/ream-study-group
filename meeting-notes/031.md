# Ream Meeting #31 Recap

## Overview

The meeting focused heavily on development progress across multiple areas and post-quantum (PQ) testnet planning. The team made significant progress on P2P networking, gossip validation, and various consensus layer features. Key discussions centered around technical challenges around peer management and execution optimization and fork choice implementation for the PQ testnet.

## Development Progress

### P2P Networking and Consensus

- **Peer Management**: Kayden implemented all assigned forwarding and validation issues and is now improving peer management systems
- **Block Validation**: Varun successfully merged beacon block validation PR and voluntary exit PR, currently working on contribution and proof gossip validation
- **Network Reliability**: Kolby enhanced P2P code reliability by adding timeouts and connection verification, enabling nodes to download blocks and blobs within the blob window

### Performance Optimization

- **Hashing Improvements**: Varun identified slow hashing implementation requiring optimization for better performance
- **State Root Calculation**: Kolby identified potential 2x improvement by using optimized libraries for native code while maintaining zkVM compatibility
- **Execution Bottlenecks**: Block execution times of 20-30 seconds identified as major bottleneck, with plans to optimize beacon chain operation codes

### Infrastructure and Tooling

- **Code Maintenance**: Jun updated Rust version to 1.88 and added bootstrap code for lean node components
- **CLI Commands**: Shariq completed voluntary exit CLI command implementation and attestation weight handling
- **Dependency Management**: Partha resolved build issues and dependency conflicts while working on PQ secret implementation

### Post-Quantum Testnet Planning

- **Fork Choice Implementation**: Unnawut conducted research on minimal beacon fork choice for PQ testnet, comparing it against 3SF alternatives and creating a pruned version of beacon chain specs with removed execution engine, slashing, merge logic, and blob support
- **Specification Development**: Jun continued reviewing and planning for PQ testnet engineering specs, with GitHub issues now raised for coordination
- **Test Case Design**: Mercy drafted test cases categorized into chaos injection, structural fault simulation, synthetic load tactics, and adversary failure modes

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Continue fork choice rule development and specification work, collaborate with Jun and Jihoon on checkpoint and epoch concepts for minimal implementation
- **Kayden**: Complete peer management improvements and continue P2P networking enhancements
- **Varun**: Finish contribution and proof gossip validation, implement hashing optimizations, and complete E2E beacon block testing
- **Kolby**: Focus on PQ testnet development, implement zkVM/native library optimization for 2x performance improvement
- **Jun**: Prepare for PQ interop calls and review Unnawut's lean specs draft
- **Shariq**: Submit EPF project proposal and shift focus toward lean consensus validator implementation
- **Mercy**: Gather additional feedback on test case specifications and collaborate on chaos engineering implementation
- **Partha**: Complete PQ secret implementation and finalize EIP feedback collection from Gajinder and Antonio
