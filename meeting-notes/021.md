# Ream Meeting #21 Recap

## Overview

This week's meeting covered significant progress across various components of the Ream client. The team discussed Checkpoint Sync implementation details, including database management and URL handling approaches. The investigation on 32-bit versus 64-bit behavior with RISC-0 and SP1 confirmed the issue stemmed from [ssz_types](https://docs.rs/ssz_types) using `usize`. The peer-to-peer implementation now successfully receives inbound messages from other peers. The team also discussed ZK-related research and potential contributions to zkVM implementations beyond the current SP1 and RISC-0 proof of concepts.

## Development Progress

- **Checkpoint Sync**: Varun submitted a PR for Checkpoint Sync implementation. The team discussed database handling behaviors, comparing approaches from existing clients like Nimbus and Lighthouse, and settled on a strategy where a provided checkpoint URL would be used only if the database is empty, with appropriate warnings for initialized databases.

- **32-bit vs 64-bit Work**: Unnawut identified that the RISC-0 and SP1 don't behave differently. The issue was related to [ssz_types](https://docs.rs/ssz_types) crate using `usize` instead of `u64`. He is now modifying `ssz_types` to work with `u64` to process the entire beacon state on the zkVM.

- **Peer-to-Peer Implementation**: Kolby reported that initial peer-to-peer implementation is now accepting inbound messages. The implementation currently supports four message types: meta, goodbye, status, and ping messages, allowing other peers to successfully communicate with the client.

- **Macro Implementation**: Kayden is working on implementing the remaining macros (about four left) and added missing tests and comments to beacon state and fork choice implementations.

- **zkVM Research**: Jun conducted research on Merkle proofs and partial SSZ integration with the help of another team member. He's developing the concept of a "Replayer" to decouple execution engine notification actions, which being async cannot be handled on the ZKVM.

- **Peer Management**: Partha submitted an initial PR for peer management functionality, which will require future iterations to implement the full feature set. He's also researching validator management changes needed when moving from BLS to Winternitz OTS scheme.

- **ENR Subnet Encoding**: Mercy fixed a bug in ENR subnet encoding that was causing peer discovery problems by creating separate types for attestation subnets and sync committee subnets with proper encoding and decoding.

- **Rewards API**: Aditya is working on the rewards API, focusing on sync committee rewards, and suggested implementing a cache system to map validator public keys to indices for more efficient fetching.

- **Beacon Headers API**: Yuttakhan is implementing beacon headers endpoint and working through some issues with filtering functionality.

## Next Steps

- Unnawut: Continue modifying `ssz_types` crate to work with `u64` rather than `usize` in order to process the entire beacon state on the ZKVM.

- Varun: Finalize Checkpoint Sync implementation, including weak subjectivity checks and handling of multiple checkpoint URLs for comparison.

- Kolby: Complete support for handling request-response messages to enable chain syncing capabilities.

- Kayden: Complete implementation of remaining macros this week.

- Jun: Continue research on integrating zkVM into the Ream client.

- Partha: Document changes needed for moving from BLS to Winternitz OTS scheme and share with the team.

- Mercy: Address any feedback on ENR subnet encoding fixes.

- Aditya: Complete remaining assigned API PRs and begin work on minimal beacon node.

- Yuttakhan: Push updated code for beacon headers endpoint and discuss errors with Kolby.

The team also noted upcoming events including the [Petra upgrade livestream on Wednesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbxaCZYtW-I) and continued community engagement through initiatives like the [Ethereum Protocol Fellowship](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-six) program, which has shown interest in beam chain related efforts.
