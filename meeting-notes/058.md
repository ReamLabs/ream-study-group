# Ream Meeting #58 Recap

## Overview

The team discussed progress across several workstreams including metrics analysis, SSZ test vectors, fork choice implementation, networking updates for devnet-3, and test fixes. Metrics data from Prometheus was analyzed, revealing generally stable client performance with a few areas for improvement such as signature verification speed. Significant progress was made on SSZ test vector generation and spec test alignment up to devnet-3. The codebase was cleaned up with devnet-1 support removed and devnet-2 set as default with scaffolding for devnet-3. Metrics requirements for devnet-3 were discussed, including whether to track duplicated versus deduplicated gossip messages, with the consensus leaning toward focusing on propagation latency rather than duplication counts. Two new participants, Rachit and Abimbola, joined the call and expressed interest in contributing to the project.

## Development Progress

### Metrics & Performance Analysis

- **Prometheus Data Analysis**: Unnawut accessed Prometheus to compile metrics into Jupyter notebooks, split by devnet runs. The client appears stable overall, but signature verification is slower than expected compared to other clients. Some metrics data is missing and needs further investigation.
- **devnet-3 Metrics**: Katya opened an issue for devnet-3 metrics, focusing on committee attestations. A draft PR is planned. Discussion around tracking duplicated vs. deduplicated gossip messages concluded that propagation latency is a higher priority than duplication tracking. Kolby suggested timestamping attestation receipt for measuring network propagation performance.

### SSZ & Spec Tests

- **SSZ Test Vectors**: Unnawut completed SSZ test vector generation and submitted a PR to the lean spec repo and a corresponding PR to Ream with all tests passing. A minor fix was needed for signature deserialization from SSZ (variable list vs. fixed bytes). PR is pending self-review before marking ready for review.
- **Spec Tests for devnet-3**: Shariq is adding spec tests up to devnet-3, leveraging some tests already generated by others. Unnawut's PR covers SSZ vectors specifically, and Shariq will handle the remaining spec test gaps.
- **EF Test Fixes**: Kayden fixed approximately 6 failing EF tests and is working on the remaining one, expected to be completed within a day or two.

### Consensus & Networking

- **Fork Choice & Attestation Handling**: Kayden implemented fork choice, half of committee aggregation, stale attestation pruning, and is currently writing tests for these. He also finished the last test case for the gear-dash test.
- **devnet-3 Networking**: Shariq implemented new gossip topics and aggregated attestation handling from gossip for the devnet-3 spec. Finalization is not yet working and is under investigation.

### Client Infrastructure

- **devnet Support Cleanup**: Kolby removed devnet-1 support, set devnet-2 as the default, and added scaffolding for devnet-3 to streamline onboarding for other contributors. He also continued investigating syncing logic improvements and handled PR reviews.
- **Request/Response & Test Issues**: Derek completed the request/response chunks limits work and picked up several test-related issues. Test data has been generated but some tests are failing. He also took over a long-standing issue from Varun related to similar test updates.

### Tooling & Syncing

- **Restart Issue**: Katya shared screenshots of a restart-related issue in the tooling. Shariq reviewed it and plans to investigate further.

### New Participants

- **Rachit**: Has been going through the documentation and plans to start contributing via good first issues in the coming week.
- **Abimbola**: Also exploring the documentation and looking to pick up an issue once familiar with the project.

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Complete self-review of the SSZ test vectors PR and mark it ready for review; continue investigating missing metrics data and submit issues as needed.
- **Shariq**: Merge Unnawut's SSZ PR, then create a PR for remaining spec tests up to devnet-3; investigate the finalization issue; look further into the restart issue Katya flagged.
- **Kayden**: Finish fixing the last failing EF test; continue implementing tests for fork choice and attestation handling.
- **Kolby**: Continue improving syncing logic.
- **Derek**: Focus on resolving the long-standing issue taken over from Varun; debug and fix failing test cases.
- **Katya**: Finalize devnet-3 metrics draft PR; explore adding gossip message type labels for better metric granularity.
- **Rachit**: Begin working on good first issues after completing documentation review.
- **Abimbola**: Continue reviewing documentation and identify an issue to contribute to.
