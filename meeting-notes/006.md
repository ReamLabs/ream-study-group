# Ream Meeting #6 Recap

## Overview

In the recent Project Update and Planning Meeting for the Ream developer team, participants shared progress updates on key initiatives, including Kolbyâ€™s implementation of Deneb types for P2P stack interoperability and Hopinheimer's PR on P2P initialization. Varun is focusing on the fork choice rules, while Parthasarathy is awaiting a cryptography paper for P2P layer work. The team discussed ZK VM research, with Jun reviewing a runtime prototype and an emphasis on BLS signature implementation. Philipp and Unnawut committed to researching various ZK VMs, centering on SP1 for its developer-friendliness. As for next steps, the team will wait on the cryptography paper before setting future objectives and will continue weekly meetings for coordination, with Unnawut tasked to prepare a presentation on consensus layer specifications for the next gathering.
