# Ream Meeting #49 Recap

## Overview

The team made progress across multiple areas of the Ream client implementation this week. Work continued on integrating production signatures into the leanSpec, though challenges remain with switching between test and production signatures. State transition tests are now complete and passing, while signature signing and verification metrics have been successfully implemented and merged. A key technical challenge emerged around Lean multisig integration, as cryptographic conversion between Lean signatures and Lean multisig signatures appears not to be possible, prompting discussions with researchers for guidance.

## Development Progress

### LeanSpec and Signature Implementation

- **Production Signatures**: Unnawut worked on integrating production signatures into the leanSpec test vectors with tests working but experiencing issues switching between test and production signatures
- **Block Building**: Varun reviewed Thomas' improved solutions for block building and storage separation, closing his own PRs in favor of the better implementations
- **Signature Metrics**: Varun implemented signature signing and verification metrics in Ream, which were merged and are visible in the Grafana dashboard

### Testing

- **State Transition Tests**: Shariq completed all state transition tests from the leanSpec, with all tests passing and PR preparation underway
- **Gossipsub Tests**: Derek finished gossipsub tests and submitted a PR
- **Fork Choice Tests**: Derek moved on to fork choice timing tests with expected PR completion this week

### LeanMultisig Integration

- **Integration Planning**: Shariq and Kayden planned the leanMultisig integration approach and outlined implementation steps
- **Cryptographic Challenges**: Investigation revealed it's likely not possible to convert between leanSig and leanMultisig signatures, which was raised with researchers for guidance
- **Implementation Work**: Shariq implemented the base outline PR, with Kayden focusing on the signing functionality portion

### Devnet Coordination

- **Devnet2 Planning**: Kolby worked on understanding the path forward for devnet2, with some uncertainty remaining around the final direction
- **Feature Flags**: New devnet2 features will be implemented behind flags until devnet1 completion, after which devnet0 support will be removed
- **Network Topics**: The team confirmed gossipsub topic strings will remain unchanged as different devnets run isolated on the same machine

### Infrastructure and Metrics

- **Dashboard Issues**: Varun identified and reported a Grafana dashboard issue that Shariq is addressing
- **Peer Metrics**: Katya is experimenting with new metrics for peer connections (connect/disconnect events and connected peer counts) that may be shared with other clients
- **Dashboard Integration**: The team confirmed their process for importing and updating Grafana dashboards from the metrics repo

### Other Updates

- **ZK Proofs**: Dimitris completed six of seven points in the draft PR, with only network setup and proof gossiping remaining
- **Study Group Preparation**: Dimitris will prepare the KoalaBear prime field presentation as the first study group session
- **Code Review**: Kayden reviewed several PRs and will fix Ethereum hashing issues affecting clippy and fmt commands

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Fix production/test signature switching issues and get PRs reviewed and merged
- **Varun**: Complete remaining testing issue in Ream
- **Shariq**: Clean up and submit state transition test PR; continue leanMultisig integration exploration
- **Kolby**: Finalize devnet2 path forward by tomorrow
- **Kayden**: Implement signing functionality for Lean multisig integration; fix Ethereum hashing issues affecting clippy and fmt
- **Demetrius**: Complete network setup and proof gossiping for draft PR; prepare Koala Bear study group presentation
- **Derek**: Complete and submit PR for fork choice timing tests
- **Utsav**: Update lean prover code from devnet0 to devnet1
