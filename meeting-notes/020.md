# Ream Meeting #20 Recap

## Overview

The meeting covered progress across multiple aspects of the REAM project. The team discussed several key updates, including the codebase upgrade from Deneb to Electra, ongoing work on peer management, database integration, and significant exploration of zkVM integration challenges. Kolby presented a detailed architectural vision for integrating zkVMs with their client, highlighting potential approaches for proof generation and verification services. Other topics included the performance comparison between SP1 and RISC Zero, and continuation features that could enable parallel execution. The team also discussed ongoing work on discovery P2P domain implementation and attestation rewards endpoints.

## Development Progress

- **Kayden**: Reviewed PRs and upgraded the codebase from Deneb to Electra to support the latest fork. Also working on an endpoint that calculates attestation rewards for all validators.

- **Varun**: Resolved parsing issues and updated to Electra. Preparing to work on Checkpoint Sync once current PRs are merged.

- **Partha**: Continuing work on peer management. Raised a question about execution layer integration, which Kayden clarified would make sense after the request-response domain is implemented.

- **Mercy**: Working on the discovery P2P domain and discussing the use of the Rand crate dependency for validator selection requirements.

- **Unnawut**: Investigated 32-bit vs. 64-bit discrepancies between SP1 and RISC Zero. Created a new [repository for the comparisons](https://github.com/ReamLabs/zkvm-playground). Found that both are producing 32-bit addresses in plain vanilla Rust code.

- **Kolby**: Caught up on commits merged in the REAM repo, mainly related to RPC and database.

- **Jun**: Presented research on zkVM integration challenges, including:
  1. Handling asynchronous behavior in a single-threaded environment
  2. Proposed service-based architecture with core, validator, prover, and verifier services
  3. Making the prover service modular to avoid depending on a single zkVM vendor
  4. Discussion of continuation features for proof composition/aggregation

## Next Steps

- **Kolby**: Investigate continuation features and async behavior approaches for zkVM integration further. Explore other zkVM options.

- **Unnawut**: Focus on zkVM work, particularly identifying what's enabling 64-bit addresses in the SP1 benchmark repo but not in zkvm-playground repo.

- **Partha**: Complete peer management implementation and submit PR this week.

- **Mercy**: Continue work on discovery P2P domain implementation.

- **Varun**: Proceed with Checkpoint Sync once current PRs are merged.

- **Kayden**: Meet with Kolby to discuss attestation rewards implementation details and submit PR by end of week.
