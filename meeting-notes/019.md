# Ream Meeting #19 Recap

## Overview

In this week's meeting, the team focused on several key development areas with progress on zkVM optimizations, database improvements, and checkpoint synchronization. Unnawut shared detailed findings on performance improvements for zkVM guest code by changing serialization strategy, resulting in a 60% reduction in cycles. Other updates included progress on request-response functionality, fork choice macro implementation, database integration, checkpoint sync serialization fixes, and peer management improvements. Jun announced plans to start integrating SP1 zkVM with the repository following completion of his midterms.

## Development Progress

### zkVM Optimizations (Unnawut):

- Refactored zkVM guest code from `read()` & `write()` to `read_slice()`/`write_slice()` methods
  - 60% cycle reduction by passing SSZ bytes and performing deserialization inside the zkVM
- Investigating differences between RISC Zero (32-bit max value) vs SP1 (64-bit max value) despite both using 32-bit RV32IM architecture
- Noted Paul's contribution using precompiles for sha2, achieving another 70% reduction
- Noted Paul's intention to benchmark swapping out of sha2 for Poseidon hashing
- Total processing time potentially reduced from 69 seconds to about 8 seconds

### Request-Response & PR Reviews (Kolby):

- Continued work on request-response functionality
- Reviewed multiple PRs on the Ream repository

### Fork Choice & Database Integration (Kayden):

- Completed implementation of the fork choice macro
- Nearly finished updating the store struct to use the database instead
- Implemented a new database table that has been merged

### Checkpoint Sync (Varun):

- Fixed serialization issues with SSZ data from the beacon APIs
- Submitted PR to address serialization/deserialization problems
- Waiting on hashmap in-memory storage to DB conversion to complete checkpoint sync

### zkVM Integration Plans (Jun):

- Planning to start integrating SP1 ZKVM with the Ream repository
- Will initially target SP1 specifically rather than creating a general interface

### Peer Management (Partha):

- Working on peer management PR in coordination with Eddie
- Split work between RPC and P2P components
- Addressing issues with node panicking on interrupt signals during peer discovery errors

## Next Steps

- Unnawut: Continue investigating 32-bit vs 64-bit zkVM differences
- Kolby: Complete the request-response implementation
- Kayden: Finish updating the store struct to use the database
- Varun: Complete checkpoint sync after database integration is finished
- Jun: Begin SP1 zkVM integration with the repository
- Partha: Resolve node panicking issues and submit the peer management PR this week
