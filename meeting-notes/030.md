# Ream Meeting #30 Recap

## Overview

The team gathered for their weekly sync to discuss progress across multiple development tracks. Key focus areas included forward syncing capabilities, gossipsub testing, post-quantum cryptography initiatives, and zkVM benchmarking efforts.

Several PRs are nearing completion, particularly around blob processing and attestation timing. The team also discussed coordination strategies for upcoming work, including the post-quantum testnet planning and zkVM proving network integration. There was significant discussion around testing approaches for gossipsub validation and the practical considerations of zkVM proving benchmarks.

## Development Progress

### P2P Networking and Syncing

- **Forward Syncing Implementation**: Kolby shipped the core forward syncing code but identified issues with request-response error handling that need to be addressed
- **Stream Timeout Mechanism**: Kolby is implementing timeout functionality for P2P streams to prevent frozen requests when syncing blobs, with plans to enable request retries to other peers
- **Sync to Finalized Point**: Once the timeout PR is completed, nodes will automatically sync to the finalized point on startup, with head syncing as the next development step

### Blob and Block Processing

- **Blob Sidecar PR**: Kayden's blob sidecar implementation is nearly complete and expected to be merged soon, with faster iteration expected on subsequent PRs
- **Beacon Block Gossip**: Varun continued work on beacon block gossip validation PR, initially planned to separate testing but now incorporating tests in the same PR due to setup complexity

### Attestation and Validation

- **Voluntary Exits**: Shariq collaborated with Mark on voluntary exits PR feedback and is working toward a mutually acceptable implementation
- **Attestation Timing**: Shariq implemented proper attestation timing logic that waits for either block proposal or one-third slot passage, requiring beacon chain event subscription
- **Gossip Validation Testing**: Discussion around testing approach for gossipsub validation, with Varun planning to use Sepolia blocks instead of mock data due to validation complexity requirements

### Post-Quantum Cryptography

- **Key Store Implementation**: Partha built a reference implementation for the post-quantum secure key store ERC, with the draft nearly ready pending additional testing
- **PQ Testnet Planning**: Unnawut worked on testnet planning documentation with plans to publish Ream's perspective and coordinate with the Zeam team on drafting the plan

### zkVM and Benchmarking

- **OpenVM Integration**: Dimitris resolved compilation issues with OpenVM and is preparing project proposal submission, focusing on benchmarking rather than expanding to additional zkVMs
- **SP1 Updates**: Jun plans to update the SP1 codebase, moving toward full block processing on zkVM
- **Proving Network Discussion**: Team discussed using external proving networks (Succinct, RISC Zero) for more practical benchmarking, while maintaining local machine benchmarks as baseline comparisons

## Next Steps

- **Kolby**: Complete timeout PR and merge forward syncing improvements
- **Kayden**: Finalize and merge blob sidecar PR, then accelerate work on subsequent PRs
- **Shariq**: Address Mark's feedback on voluntary exits PR and get attestation timing PR reviewed
- **Varun**: Create scaffolding PR for gossip validation testing framework, complete beacon block gossip validation with Sepolia block tests
- **Partha**: Complete additional testing on post-quantum key store implementation and coordinate ERC review with Antonio
- **Unnawut**: Publish PQ testnet planning perspective, coordinate with Zeam team, wait for Varun's scaffolding before continuing gossip subtasks, research 3SF integration possibilities
- **Dimitri**: Submit project proposal, benchmark OpenVM performance
- **Jun**: Update SP1 codebase, implement full block processing on zkVM, contact SP1 team about proving network access
