# Ream Meeting #41 Recap

## Overview

The team gathered to discuss progress following the Cambridge Interop event and updates on devnet0 preparation. The meeting highlighted successful multi-client interoperability testing between Ream, Zeam, and Qlean clients, though challenges remain in networking configurations and consensus implementation details.

Key technical work continues on zkVM proof integration, benchmarking different zkVM implementations, and establishing metrics for devnet1. The team is now transitioning toward devnet1 specifications while resolving several blockers around test vectors.

## Development Progress

### Cambridge Interop

- **Multi-client Testing**: Jun and Unnawut successfully ran a devnet internally with two instances each of Ream, Zeam, and Qlean clients, achieving finalization across numerous slots on Jun's machine
- **Networking Issues**: Most problems encountered involved P2P layer configurations, particularly around anonymous mode between client implementations
- **Consensus Alignment**: Minor specification interpretation differences addressed, including slot timing precision and the genesis state of each client
- **Specification Gaps**: Team identified need for proper test vectors to streamline future interop debugging rather than manual state comparison

### zkVM Proof Integration

- **State Transition Proof**: Dimitris and Utsav created a draft PR for integrating state transition proofs in the Ream client with a CLI flag for block proposers to generate proofs
- **Architecture Decisions**: Team discussed whether proofs should be sent back to proposers or directly gossiped to the network, leaning toward direct gossip as the proposer does not need to further act on the proof
- **Non-deterministic Challenges**: Identified async functions in block production as problematic for zkVM deterministic input requirements; focusing on proving state transitions first rather than full block production
- **Ring Dependency Issues**: Utsav encountered ring dependency errors in consensus lean crate, requiring another zkVM flag similar to previous solution

### zkVM Benchmarking

- **Unified Host Implementation**: Utsav developed a unified benchmarking host for Risc0, SP1, Zisk, and Pico, with plans to add Jolt and OpenVM
- **Performance Results**: Risc0 (without precompiles) and Zisk showed similar execution times; SP1 unexpectedly showed 3x slower performance; Pico demonstrated significantly slower performance
- **Profiling Capabilities**: Complete sub-operation benchmarks available for Risc0 and SP1; Zisk and Pico only provide final execution time and cycles as guest profiling not yet implemented
- **Next Steps**: Utsav working with Zisk team to enable individual operation benchmarking and planning to publish comprehensive benchmark comparison by end of week

### State Container and Testing

- **Test Implementation**: Shariq ported all tests from leanSpec except one justification/finalization test that requires diagnosis
- **Test Vector Dependency**: Work paused on handwritten tests pending release of official test vectors for consumption
- **Metrics Integration**: Planning to implement metrics proposed by Katya, necessary for devnet1

### Client Development

- **Retry Logic**: Kayden implemented retry logic for connecting to execution nodes, with completion expected soon
- **Lean State RPC**: Varun merged lean state RPC changes and reviewed Jun's Cambridge PRs
- **Devnet1 Preparation**: Unnawut reviewing specs by Gajinder for devnet1; team monitoring for hashtree updates and other specification changes

### Metrics and Monitoring

- **Dashboard Development**: Katya developed metrics dashboard for single client monitoring with plans for separate Interop dashboard for multi-client DevOps view
- **Metrics Coverage**: Identified missing metrics in current Ream implementation; Shariq to implement complete set from specifications
- **Local Testing**: Katya needs assistance setting up local Ream node and local interop environment between Qlean and Ream for metrics validation
- **Gossipsub Metrics**: Planning to add gossipsub metrics to monitor network health and message volume

### Documentation

- **Command Reference**: Shariq to take over issue for adding CLI commands to Ream book
- **Grafana Integration**: Shariq successfully set up Grafana with local pqdevnet and will submit PR for team use

## Next Steps

- **Jun**: Open new meta tracking issue with updated context for PQ signature integration; assist Katya with local Ream node setup and testing commands
- **Unnawut**: Review Gajinder's devnet1 specifications
- **Varun**: Monitor spec updates and PRs; determine next development priorities
- **Shariq**: Diagnose failing justification/finalization test; implement complete metrics set from specifications; complete Ream book CLI commands documentation; submit Grafana integration PR for local pqdevnet
- **Kayden**: Complete retry logic implementation for execution node connections; continue devnet1 planning
- **Dimitris**: Create GitHub issue to track zkVM proof integration work (moving from draft PR description); include discussion of consensus voting timing with 200-slot proof generation delay
- **Utsav**: Create issue for ring dependency error in consensus lean crate; finalize Zisk individual operation benchmarking with team call; complete Jolt integration fixes; publish comprehensive zkVM benchmark comparison by end of week; collaborate with Dimitris on adding OpenVM to benchmarking suite
- **Katya**: Publish draft dashboard for devnet0 metrics; work with Jun and team on local Ream setup; finalize buckets after production load testing; transition metrics PR from draft to open
