# Ream Meeting #52 Recap

## Overview

This was a light meeting held on December 30th, with reduced attendance due to the end-of-year holidays. The team shared brief updates on their ongoing work, including a review for the leanSpec, successful integration of the ERE framework with devnet-0, continued work on networking and Beacon API implementations, and resolution of a blocking issue in the fork logic upgrade. Most team members plan to take the next couple of days off for New Year celebrations.

## Development Progress

### Specification Work

- **Signature Aggregation Review**: Unnawut completed reviewing the signature aggregation PR for the leanSpec and finding opportunities for simplification. PR suggestions will be proposed in the coming week.

### zkVM Integration

- **ERE Framework Integration**: Dimitri successfully integrated the ERE framework with the devnet-0 prototype. ERE is now working and generating proofs successfully using a Docker-based approach where the guest runs inside a container with all dependencies. The framework supports 7-8 different zkVM options and operates asynchronously so the client isn't blocked during proof generation. The next step is to migrate this work to devnet-1, replacing the previous RISC Zero implementation with ERE.

### Client Development

- **Networking and Beacon API**: Mihir completed two PR reviews (networking and Beacon API). Several outstanding issues remain for both the Beacon API meta issue and networking implementations.
- **Fork Logic Upgrade**: Derek resolved the blocking issue that was preventing progress on the fork logic upgrade and is now ready to complete this work.

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Submit PR suggestions for simplifying the signature aggregation section in the leanSpec
- **Dimitri**: Migrate ERE integration from devnet-0 to devnet-1 once Utsav completes his integration work
- **Mihir**: Address remaining Beacon API and networking issues
- **Derek**: Complete the fork logic upgrade
