# Ream Meeting #28 Recap

## Overview

This week's Ream development call focused on significant progress across multiple fronts, with team members advancing work on builder specifications, P2P gossip implementation, validator functionality, and network architecture improvements.

The team also addressed scheduling conflicts with other Ethereum protocol calls and decided to move future meetings to Tuesdays to better accommodate the broader ecosystem calendar. With several team members preparing to attend the upcoming Beam Day event in Cannes, the call highlighted strong momentum in both technical development and community engagement.

## Development Progress

### Builder Specifications & Validator Integration

- **Builder Specs Implementation**: Varun completed the validator portion of builder specifications and is now focusing on integrating external builder support with existing validators, including research on payload selection logic between external builders and local execution clients
- **Circuit Breaker Development**: Work has begun on implementing circuit breaker functionality to determine when to switch from external builders to local execution clients based on performance metrics

### P2P Network & Gossip Implementation

- **Gossipsub Validation**: Unnawut identified missing validation and propagation logic in the P2P codebase and created corresponding issues for implementation
- **Network Manager Refactoring**: Unnawut attempted to refactor the growing Network Manager service to separate concerns between network configuration, initialization, and message handling
- **Blob Sidecar Implementation**: Kayden switched focus from slashing to blob sidecar gossip implementation due to higher priority, with test development in progress

### Validator & Account Management

- **Attestation Functions**: Shariq added attestation submission and aggregate proof functions to validator code and is preparing for testnet deployment with 32 ETH
- **Voluntary Exits**: Shariq implemented voluntary exit functionality to prevent ongoing penalties during testing
- **Account Manager Architecture**: Partha, Shariq, and Mark decided to keep the account manager as a separate executable while continuing beacon chain validator development
- **ERC Development**: Partha drafted an ERC for validator key cryptography changes, currently under review with plans for more feedback

### Sync Committee & Forward Sync

- **Forward Sync Architecture**: Kolby made significant progress on forward sync implementation with clearer structural design and plans to add timeout handling for peer response edge cases
- **Sync Committee Improvements**: Patchy modified sync committee functionality from slot-based to slot interval-based operation for better aggregator method control and added custom timeout capabilities for validator methods

### Code Quality & Infrastructure

- **64-bit Issue Resolution**: Unnawut completed fixes for 64-bit compatibility issues across the codebase
- **Code Cleanup**: Kayden improved code readability by expanding abbreviated variables and fixed blob storage directory creation issues
- **Documentation**: Unnawut added p2p documentation compatible with the project book and improved code comments

## Next Steps

- **Varun**: Research and document payload selection logic between external builders and local execution clients, implement circuit breaker functionality
- **Kayden**: Complete blob sidecar gossip implementation testing and finalize related PR
- **Kolby**: Implement timeout handling for forward sync peer responses and complete forward sync functionality
- **Shariq**: Test validator implementation on testnet with 32 ETH deposit, await Mark's PR for testnet deployment
- **Partha**: Address failing test cases in key store implementation, seek wider community review for ERC draft
- **Unnawut**: Continue gossipsub light client update implementation
- **Patchy**: Continue sync committee development with custom timeout implementations for validator methods
- **Kolby**: Update meeting calendar to move future calls to Tuesdays at the same UTC time, cancel next week's call due to Beam Day event
