# Ream Meeting #23 Recap

## Overview

The meeting featured key updates across multiple workstreams including P2P networking, checkpoint sync, validator client development, and Merkle tree optimizations. Several first-time contributors joined the call, bringing fresh perspectives and additional development capacity to the team. The team also noted that their project ideas were merged into the EPF repository, and that the upcoming EPF cohort will launch in early June with approximately 20 participants, including several Beam chain client contributors.

## Development Progress

### P2P Networking

- **Vid:** Initial support for gossipsub implemented, enabling the client to receive gossip blocks
- **Kolby:** Work in progress on backfill downloader to request blocks by providing a start slot
- **Kolby:** Implementation of proper request response handling to prevent peers from dropping connections

### Checkpoint Sync

- **Varun & Kolby:** Completed initial checkpoint sync setup with base state and block to start from
- **Varun:** Fixed bugs in beacon APIs that prevented certain getter APIs from working
- **Kayden:** Added support for reading network config YAML into network spec for Mainnet, Holesky and other networks

### Validator Client Development

- **Shariq:** Started implementing functions for a validator client, working through the Phase 0 spec
- **Patchy:** Completed execution requests including prepare execution payloads, get eth1 pending deposit count, and compute on-chain aggregate
- **Patchy:** Added the missing aggregate method for BLS signature in Electra spec
- **Ladislaus:** Noted the importance of implementing the [standardized key manager API](https://ethereum.github.io/keymanager-APIs/) to ensure validator client interoperability with different consensus layer clients.

### Merkle Package & zkVM Integration

- **Jun:** Added multi-proof functionality to Ream's merkle package
- **Jun:** Implemented SP1 precompile for Merkle tree node hashing, reducing cycles from 21 million to 6 million
- **Jun & Unnawut:** Working on serializing validators field for process block header

### Ream Website

- **Unnawut:** Progress made on the Ream website, aiming to launch within one to two weeks

## Next Steps

- **Jun**: Continue work on serialization issues in zkVM.
- **Kolby**: Complete the backfill downloader and implement optimistic sync to go from the last 128 slots to the head.
- **Varun**: Finish remaining beacon APIs and implement subjectivity checks.
- **Kayden**: Complete PR for fetching genesis validator root from beacon state instead of using hardcoded values.
- **Vid**: Work on handling and deserializing gossip blocks to convert them to the correct format.
- **Unnawut**: Share details about integrating ream-consensus crate into zkVM by the next meeting.
- **Patchy**: Optimize compute on-chain aggregate implementation and add tests.
- **Shariq**: Continue implementing validator client functions through the Phase 0 spec.
