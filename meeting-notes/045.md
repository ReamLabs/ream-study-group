# Ream Meeting #45 Recap

## Overview

This week's meeting focused on progress across multiple workstreams as the team prepares for devnet1 and DevConnect in Buenos Aires. The team discussed timeline adjustments for devnet1, with mid-November looking challenging due to DevConnect travel and signing/validation implementation still in progress.

Significant progress was made on the Lean spec, STF implementation, and zkVM integration efforts. EPF participants Demetrius and Utsav are wrapping up their fellowship work and will present their zkVM integration progress before DevConnect. The team also discussed DevConnect logistics and networking strategies for those attending.

## Development Progress

### LeanSpec and Reviews

- **LeanSpec Work**: Unnawut spent the majority of last week on Lean spec reviews and testing fork choice re-orgs, planning to shift focus more toward post-devnet1 work such as zkvm and consensus mechanisms
- **Documentation and Testing**: Varun updated documentation, added tests for empty block cases, and fixed a bug where client vectors had missing data
- **Test Infrastructure**: Shariq submitted a PR for the new hash tree interface and will focus on testing over the next two days before DevConnect

### Client Implementation

- **STF Implementation**: Kayden completed the latest STF logic implementation, adding three new tables to the store struct and database, implementing remove, iterator, and drain functions, and simplifying the database code
- **Fork Choice Logic**: Kayden fixed deadlock issues that caused Ream to fail and reformatted fork choice code to better match the spec, expecting to complete fork choice implementation today
- **Devnet Timeline**: Kolby is working to formalize the devnet timeline and create a framework to prevent blocking between teams, particularly focusing on request-response domain connections for devnet2

### zkVM Integration

- **OpenVM Progress**: Dimitris successfully integrated OpenVM as a standalone after dependency issues, generating proofs for the beacon chain STF in ~10 hours on older hardware
- **Lean zkVM Integration**: Utsav added the prover service in parallel to Lean chain service and generated valid proofs up to 1000 slots (5 proofs) before hitting memory limitations on M2 with 16GB RAM
- **Beacon State Prover**: Utsav integrated the prover for beacon state work but hasn't completed testing yet due to the 2-3 hour runtime expected
- **Performance Challenges**: State size growth caused proof generation to fail beyond 200 slot durations, with the team identifying RAM as the bottleneck

### Infrastructure and Tooling

- **Kurtosis Package**: Jun worked on the PQ devnet package mimicking Ethereum package developer experience with YAML configuration and one-command deployment, targeting completion before Buenos Aires trip
- **Local Network Setup**: Dimitris attempted to set up a local network with four validators but encountered issues, deferring completion until after DevConnect

### EPF Fellowship

- **Documentation**: Dimitris is completing EPF documentation requirements (1.5 of 3 documents finished)
- **Presentation Prep**: Both EPF participants will prepare presentations on their zkVM integration work to share with the Ream team before DevConnect

## Next Steps

- **Kayden**: Complete fork choice logic implementation and testing for finalized slot issues, then move to next PR
- **Unnawut**: Investigate post-devnet1 work such as zkVM support and consensus mechanisms, review Cambridge workshop updates
- **Jun**: Finish Kurtosis package documentation before Buenos Aires departure, maintain PR review availability during DevConnect with reduced coding capacity
- **Varun**: Investigate possible Lean spec bug with Thomas, coordinate with Shariq on client vectors
- **Kolby**: Formalize devnet timeline framework and investigate request-response domain requirements for devnet2
- **Shariq**: Complete testing work in next two days or hand off to interested team members (Varun, Kayden) before DevConnect
- **Dimitris**: Complete remaining EPF documentation (1-1.5 documents), wrap up DevConnect preparations, resume full availability after presentations on Monday
- **Utsav**: Clean up zkVM integration code, test beacon state prover on different devices, prepare EPF presentation with Demetrius, explore options for GPU-based proving post-DevConnect
