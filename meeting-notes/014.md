Kolby shared insights from the EF retreat and Portal Summit, while Kayden reported progress on the rewards macro for testing and fixed state functions that were out of specs. Jun is focused on integrating SP1 with Ream and introducing STF mode to perform epoch/block/slot processing in the project, and Varun is set to open an initial pull request for beacon APIs. Unnawut is progressing on the partial state update and verifying Merkle inclusion within a zkVM, alongside creating the Beam Roadmap website.
