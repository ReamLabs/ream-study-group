# Ream Meeting #24 Recap

## Overview

The team began with a study group sharing session on "Executing Ream's Beacon State Transition Functions in a zkVM" (video available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx0gSVulD1Q) before proceeding to development updates.

The team made significant progress across multiple areas this week, with a strong focus on peer-to-peer networking, validator functions, and addressing zkVM compatibility issues. Key developments included implementing network message handling, advancing gossip subtopic functionality, completing validator-related functions, and identifying solutions for the SSZ 64-bit compatibility problem with SP1. The team is moving toward a more integrated system with improved P2P capabilities and validator operations.

## Study Group Sharing Session: Executing Ream's Beacon State Transition Functions in a zkVM

### Key Components Covered

#### Ream State Transition Functions (STFs)
- **Purpose**: Validate blocks and apply state changes in Ethereum's consensus layer
- **Structure**: Organized around epochs (32 slots each), with blocks filling most slots
- **Main Components**:
  - Beacon blocks and beacon block body (actual block content)
  - Beacon state (persistent data like validators, balances)
- **Three main processing phases**:
  - Process slots
  - Process epoch (every 32 slots)
  - Process block

#### zkVM Implementation Approach
- **Architecture**: Host-guest model
  - **Host machine**: Untrusted, handles data preprocessing and post-processing
  - **Guest machine**: Trusted, runs inside zkVM, generates proofs
- **Goal**: Replace individual node processing with proof verification system
- **Challenge**: Performance constraints due to zkVM limitations (single-threaded, arithmetic-heavy operations)

### Early Optimizations Achieved

#### 1. Deserialization Strategy
- **Change**: Moved SSZ deserialization from host to guest
- **Result**: ~60% cycle reduction (46M â†’ 18M cycles)

#### 2. Partial Beacon State
- **Approach**: Only pass required fields instead of entire beacon state
- **Implementation**: Include Merkle proofs for verification
- **Result**: Additional ~60% cycle reduction

#### 3. Pre-compiled Functions
- **Focus**: Used RISCZero's SHA2 pre-compiles instead of native implementations
- **Result**: 72% cycle reduction
- **Note**: Identified as "quick win" for any zkVM implementation

### Next Steps

#### Benchmarking Across zkVMs
- **Targets**: SP1, OpenVM, Jolt, Plonky3, and others
- **Goals**:
  - Test out-of-the-box compatibility with Ream consensus
  - Compare performance metrics
  - Prepare for BeamChain specifications

#### 64-bit SSZ Libraries
- **Issue**: Most libraries use `usize` but zkVMs operate on 32-bits
- **Impact**: Lists exceeding 32-bit limits cause issues
- **Status**: Ongoing work to resolve

#### Poseidon2 Hash Integration
- **Context**: Suggested by Justin Drake as BeamChain's target hashing algorithm
- **Current Status**: Prototype shows ~30 minutes per operation vs 6 seconds with SHA2
- **Challenge**: Significant performance gap needs addressing for practical deployment

### Key Contributors
- Unnawut, Jun, Vid, Paul (zkVM implementations)
- Ream contributors (consensus specifications)

### Repository Information
- **Risc Zero implementation**: https://github.com/ReamLabs/consenzero-bench
- **SP1 implementation**: https://github.com/ReamLabs/consensp1us

**Note**: All demonstrated code is prototype-level, not production-ready, using test data from consensus specifications.

## Development Progress

### Networking and P2P Infrastructure

- **Kolby** implemented a network manager to handle peer-to-peer messages across request-response and gossip domains. Currently working on request handling and block backfiller development.

- **Kayden** replaced hard-coded Genesis validator routes with dynamic initialization and implemented missing fork choice functions. Currently connecting P2P gossip messages to network manager and implementing engine API methods.

### API and Protocol Implementation

- **Varun** implemented gossip subdomain functionality and completed two beacon APIs. Opened PR for weak subjectivity checks, will assist Kolby with P2P networking once completed.

### Validator Functionality

- **Shariq** implemented attestation, sync committee, and aggregation functions. Added signature functionality to lean BLS implementation. Validator implementation nearly complete per honest validator specs.

- **Patchy** completed signature aggregation and validator methods including on-chain aggregate candidate block functions. Transitioning from validator functions to API development.

### Infrastructure and Technical Challenges

- **Unnawut** worked on ream website and presentation preparation. Discussed SSZ 64-bit compatibility issue with Jihoon.

- **Jihoon** investigated SSZ 64-bit compatibility issues with SP1 integration. Identified serialization conflicts and deserialization crashes from 32-bit architecture limitations. Proposed forking Ethereum SSZ dependencies as least invasive solution.

## Next Steps

- **Jihoon** - Implement the proposed SSZ solution to address 32-bit zkVM compatibility, collaborate with Unnawut on resolving the SSZ 64-bit issue, and schedule technical discussion session with Jun if interested

- **Kolby** - Complete request handling implementation for the request domain, continue development of the block backfiller system, and accept assistance from Varun once weak subjectivity checks are completed

- **Kayden** - Finish connecting P2P gossip messages to network manager, complete implementation of remaining engine API methods, and integrate fork choice functions with beacon chain struct

- **Varun** - Complete and merge weak subjectivity checks pull request, then transition to supporting Kolby on P2P networking tasks

- **Shariq** - Begin implementation of beacon APIs for validator functionality and finalize any remaining honest validator specification requirements

- **Patchy** - Start development of validator APIs and complete transition from validator functions to API implementation

- **Unnawut** - Continue collaboration with Jihoon on SSZ compatibility resolution and ream website
