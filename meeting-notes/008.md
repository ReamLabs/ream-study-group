# Ream Meeting #8 Recap

## Overview

The meeting focused on key advancements and challenges within the Ream development team. Unnawut detailed work on the state transition function facing RISC V compatibility issues, while Jun is building this function from scratch, emphasizing the need for external insights on specific Beam chain problems. Justin Drake shared updates from the Grandine team, including ongoing integrations and an impending monthly call for collaboration on Beam-related projects. The team also discussed the implementation of native rollups and onboarding new coordinators to facilitate research within the Ethereum Foundation. Action items were assigned to team members for continued progress, including further development on state transition functions and preparations for future study sessions.

## Notes

## Project updates
- Reiteration of the 2 main repositories for Ream team's work: the [ream repo](https://github.com/ReamLabs/ream) (the actual implementation) and [ream-study-group repo](https://github.com/ReamLabs/ream-study-group) (learning resources)
- Unnawut working on implementing the state transition function into zkVM ([Risc0](https://github.com/risc0/risc0)), facing RISC V compatibility issues
  - Unnawut suggested building the Ream codebase for minimal beacon states and basic transitions to avoid compatibility issues
- Jun working on building state transition function from scratch on Ream codebase as well but on [SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1)
- Varun implemented most phase zero functions in Ream core repository

## Updates from Justin Drake
- Justin planning to start monthly call for teams working on Beam
- Grandine team working on integrations with SP1 and Risc0, applied for Ethereum Foundation grant
  - The Grandine team is actively working on integrating with SP1 and RISC0, focusing on addressing various technical challenges.
  - They have applied for a grant from the Ethereum Foundation to support their efforts in enhancing their existing Beacon client.
  - If the grant is approved, the team plans to allocate significant engineering resources to resolve dependency and tooling issues related to the integrations.
- On APS (Attester-Proposer Separation)
  - Likely to land before the beam chain
  - Hope to have a concrete EIP within the next few months and decide the direction from there
  - Tracking website at https://aps.directory/
- Introduction of https://ethproofs.org website launch
- On hash-based signatures paper and performance metrics
  - The hash-based signatures paper discusses the performance metrics of various signature schemes, highlighting their efficiency and security.
  - The signing and verification processes for the discussed hash-based signatures are extremely fast, taking less than 1 millisecond each.
  - The paper outlines the generation time for public keys, indicating that pre-generating keys for a million signatures may take around 10 minutes, though this could be optimized further.
- On native rollups
  - Native rollups are synergistic with the Beam chain, sharing similar technology and requirements around ZKVM diversity and performance, thus native rollups is expected to accelerate timelines for the Beam chain
  - No significant changes anticipated for CL with native rollups

## Action items

### Justin Drake
- Introduce Ream team to Grandine team for collaboration
- Start monthly call for teams working on Beam
- Prepare slides on native rollups for a future study session
- Introduce new coordinators to the team once onboarded

### Unnawut Leepaisalsuwanna
- Continue working on state transition function and build from scratch

### Jun Song
- Build state transition function from scratch on Ream codebase
- Work on wrapping state transition function into a ZKVM-compatible program

### Varun Doshi
- Implement state transition function directly in Ream and integrate ZKVM

### Parthasarathy Ramanujam
- Share recording of the meeting once ready
