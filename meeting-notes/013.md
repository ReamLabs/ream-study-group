# Ream Meeting #13 Recap

## Overview

The team reported progress toward Q1 milestones with Unnawut working on partial state updates using the Alex's `ssz_rs` crate, Kayden implementing spec tests, and Partha exploring Rateless IBLT and Nexus's zkVM. Justin noted improvements in post-quantum signature performance.

The team confirmed they're on track with Q1 milestones for both ZK state transition proof-of-concept implementations using SP1 and Risc0, while P2P networking components are on track to completion with discv5 and GossipSub implementation pending.

Moving into Q2, they'll focus potentially on benchmarking additional zkVM systems and implementing state propagation and verification. Hopinheimer volunteered to present on GossipSub v2 and related proposals in an upcoming study session.

## Team Updates

- **Unnawut:** Working on partial state updates for Ethereum consensus layer trying to implement with Alex's `ssz_rs` to support partial inclusion proof and state updates. Goal is to process block headers in zkVM without passing the entire state. A lot of tedius work:
  - The BeaconState has a lot of nested structs, all of which need to implement the traits that `ssz_rs` requires.
  - Ream codebase uses `ssz_types`, which also does not support `ssz_rs`.
  - Rust has something called the orphan rule that prevents trait implementations if the project did not define the struct nor the trait, adding extra work to implement the traits.
- **Jun:** No significant updates due to academic commitments.
- **Partha:** Experimenting with RISD library from Li Yang's paper and exploring Nexus zkVM's Rust version to understand differences from SP1 and Risc0.
- **Kayden:** Implementing spec tests for process block and epoch processing. Found and fixed some misimplementations in beacon state functions, still working on remaining issues.
- **Vid:** Investigating Milhouse library for partial updates and re-merkleization. Exploring if selective fields can be sent directly with Merkle proofs.
- **Justin:**
  - Post-quantum signature aggregation performance improved from 2,500 to 3,250 signatures/second
  - New collaborator (Emile) working on reducing proof size and verifier complexity
  - Planning Beam call #3 focusing on P2P networking
  - Ethereum Foundation retreat was productive; testing and EELS teams interested in helping with Python specs
  - Danny Ryan (now with Etherealize) joined Beam calls group

## Project Status (Q1 Milestone Review)

### ZK State Transition:

  - Proof of concept with SP1 and Risc0 almost complete
  - Client can prove state transition with selected zkVM (SP1 and Risc0)
  - Self-verification is straightforward, just one extra line of code
  - Benchmarking done for SP1, pending for Risc0
  - On track to completion within Q1

### P2P Networking:

  - Basic discovery setup is running
  - Partial implementation of GossipSub with PR from Vid pending
  - Some discovery functions still need implementation
  - Team plans to integrate with mainnet rather than creating isolated simulation
  - May use Shadow for testing instead of full mainnet simulation

## Upcoming

Q2 will focus on:

  - Potentially benchmarking additional zkVM systems
  - Implementing zk state propagation and verification between client instances

## Action Items

- Unnawut continues working on partial state update
- Hopinheimer offered to present on GossipSub v2 and other P2P networking proposals in an upcoming study group session
- Owner TBD: Implement and merge the PR for GossipSub implementation
- Owner TBD: Implement a persistent client that continuously performs zk state transitions every N blocks
