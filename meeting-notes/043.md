# Ream Meeting #43 Recap

## Overview

The team gathered to share progress updates ahead of DevConnect, with several members preparing to travel to Argentina. The meeting covered significant developments across the Lean specs, Ream implementation, metrics dashboard, and zkVM integration work. A notable breakthrough was achieved by Dimitris and Utsav, who successfully ran proof generation and gossiping capabilities.

## Development Progress

### Lean Spec

- **Attestation terminology update**: Jun reviewed spec PRs including the spec test framework, which successfully generated test vectors locally with a single command. He also opened a PR changing "vote" to "attestation" throughout the codebase for improved clarity.
- **Gossip topics**: Varun updated gossip topic names from "vote" to "attestation" in Ream client and added Python specs for gossip topics that were previously only documented in markdown files.

### Ream Implementation

- **Signature scheme integration**: Varun added the new Hash-Sig signature scheme by creating a PR on the hash-sig repository, then imported it into Ream and updated containers for vote and attestation.
- **Configuration optimization**: Varun removed the number of validators from the config container to directly use validators length from the state.
- **Hash-Sig key management**: Kayden worked on adding functionality for restoring and recovering Hash-Sig key pairs, with a PR expected by end of day. He also updated several crates following a recent merge.

### Metrics and Monitoring

- **Dashboard implementation**: Shariq implemented all Lean metrics in the Lean client and created his own working dashboard. He received Katya's dashboard and plans to collaborate with her to complete the integration this week.

### zkVM Integration

- **Proof generation milestone**: Dimitris and Utsav successfully ran proof generation and gossiping capabilities. Proof validation is still pending implementation.
- **Architecture considerations**: The current implementation stalls operations until proof generation completes, which needs architectural improvements.
- **Benchmarking**: Plans to clean up previous beacon chain state transition work and generate concrete benchmarks for both sub-projects before DevConnect.
- **GPU proving infrastructure**: Following advice from the Risc0 team, the focus shifted from execution cycles to proof generation metrics. Discussion centered on renting AWS Linux machines with GPU support, though concerns arose about costs and zkVM GPU compatibility.
- **Hardware testing**: Shariq offered his 3070 Ti GPU (8GB VRAM) for testing before committing to expensive AWS resources. This would also help validate Utsav's Beacon Harness implementation on different devices.

## Next Steps

- **Jun**: Continue with spec PR reviews and begin implementing courtesy improvements discussed previously
- **Varun**: Continue work on Lean spec and Ream container updates
- **Shariq**: Collaborate with Katya to complete metrics dashboard integration
- **Kayden**: Complete Hash-Sig key pair restoration/recovery PR and continue addressing open issues
- **Unnawut**: Focus on Lean spec tasks (signatures, tests, or test vector generation) pending task assignment coordination
- **Dimitris**: Finish proof validation implementation, include changes in draft PR, and generate concrete benchmarks for state transition work before DevConnect
- **Utsav**: Update codebase to include proof generation, test GPU proving setup with Shariq, investigate GPU support across zkVMs (SP1, Risc0, Jolt, Pico), and work on DevConnect presentation
