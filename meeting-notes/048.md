# Ream Meeting #48 Recap

## Overview

The team gathered for a progress update focused on interoperability testing and devnet 1 progress. Significant technical achievements included resolving genesis block compatibility issues between Ream and other clients, dramatically improving CI build times from 2 hours to 12 minutes, and successful interoperability testing. The team successfully ported fork choice test vectors from the [leanSpec](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec) to Ream, implemented various specification updates, and made progress on the Beacon Chain API endpoints.

## Development Progress

### Core Client Development

- **Lean-Sig Migration**: Varun changed [hash-sig](https://github.com/b-wagn/hash-sig) to [leanSig](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSig) and fixed zkVM build failures caused by imprecise constants in leanSig. Kolby coordinated breaking changes across teams during the leanSig migration.
- **Test Integration**: Varun ported three test suites from leanSpec to Ream with more tests planned. Shariq merged Fork choice test vectors from Lean Spec and is working on state transition tests, with plans to build CI for automated test updates.
- **Attestation Logic**: Varun added a break to the attestation walkback and renamed the compute LMD ghost head function.
- **Block Production**: Varun separated block production and storage in the leanSpec and removed redundant state root calculations after block production.

### Infrastructure & DevOps

- **CI Optimization**: Kolby reduced Docker build times from 2 hours to 12 minutes (12x improvement) by switching from QEMU to cross-compilation for ARM images, and added Rust caching which halved CI times overall.
- **Validator Registry**: Kayden reimplemented the Validator registry file using the new format from [lean-quickstart](https://github.com/blockblaz/lean-quickstart).

### Interoperability & Testing

- **Genesis Issues**: Kolby debugged genesis block incompatibility between Ream and other clients, discovering bugs on both sides that were quickly resolved through group collaboration.
- **Interop Testing**: Kayden conducted extensive interop testing between Ream and other clients. Unnawut focused on debugging justification and finalization slots after SSZ issues were resolved, and tested integration with [lean-quickstart](https://github.com/blockblaz/lean-quickstart) and [leanMetrics](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanMetrics).
- **Gossip Testing**: Derek made progress on gossip subtesting, gaining confidence with the codebase structure.

### API Development

- **Beacon Chain API**: Mihir completed the peers endpoint and is finalizing the events endpoint for draft PR review.

### Planning & leanSpec

- **Devnet Planning**: Unnawut created a [high-level plan summary for devnet-1](https://github.com/leanEthereum/pm/blob/main/breakout-rooms/leanConsensus/pq-interop/pq-devnet-1.md) in the leanEthereum/pm repo.
- **Signature Vectors**: Unnawut is finishing signature test vectors for the Lean Spec repo.

## Next Steps

- **Varun**: Complete porting remaining 2-3 tests from leanSpec to Ream
- **Kolby**: Participate in devnet-1 interop testing & bug fixing
- **Kayden**: Continue specification change implementations
- **Shariq**: Create PR for leanSpec state transition tests, build CI for automated test runs and updates, investigate Lean VM status
- **Unnawut**: Complete signature test vectors for leanSpec repo, participate in devnet-1 interop testing
- **Jun**: Identify contribution opportunities for devnet-2 and infrastructure beyond devnet-1
- **Mihir**: Finalize events endpoint and open draft PR for review
- **Derek**: Complete gossip subtesting PR and move to next testing task
