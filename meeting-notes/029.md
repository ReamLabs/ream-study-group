# Ream Meeting #29 Recap

## Overview

Due to EthCC and Beam Day events, the team skipped last week's meeting and conducted a comprehensive two-week update covering progress across multiple development streams. Key highlights included refactoring of networking modules and implementation of 3SF in Rust, preparation for a post-quantum testnet following Beam Day discussions, and continued development of core consensus functionality. The team made significant progress on gossipsub validation, voluntary exit commands, and sync committee implementation. New participant Dimitri joined to work on zkVM integration. The meeting emphasized coordination for the upcoming post-quantum testnet and preparation for integration testing before beacon validator's testnet deployment.

## Development Progress

### Networking and Gossipsub

- **Networking refactoring**: Unnawut refactored networking modules to enable additional gossipsub logic and reviewed related PRs
- **Beacon Block Validation**: Varun implemented gossip sub validation for Beacon Blocks and fixed ENR propagation issues
- **Blob Sidecar Implementation**: Kayden worked on Blob Sidecar Gossip functionality, implementing required functions and network-specific peer queries
- **Peer Scoring**: Varun preparing to work on peer scoring and additional gossip validation

### Consensus and Syncing

- **3SF Implementation**: Unnawut implemented 3SF in Rust based on the published paper and Vitalik's Python implementation, with repo available for experimentation at https://github.com/ReamLabs/rust-3sf
- **Forward Syncing**: Kolby focused on completing the forward syncer implementation with testing phase underway
- **Head Syncing**: Kolby planning to implement head syncer functionality as the next consensus milestone
- **Sync Committee**: Patchy completed sync committee implementation

### Validator Operations

- **Voluntary Exit**: Shariq implemented end-to-end voluntary exit CLI command with validator index specification and optional wait functionality
- **Validator Management**: Discussion on safety considerations for bulk validator exits and implementation of confirmation prompts

### Infrastructure and Testing

- **Integration Testing**: Patchy setting up validator integration tests with Kurtosis and server infrastructure for testnet readiness
- **Debug Endpoints**: Jun implemented debug endpoints and identified performance issues with beacon state hash tree root calculations
- **Testnet Strategy**: Planning to test validator functionality with existing beacon clients before full deployment

### zkVM Research

- **zkVM Integration**: Dimitri began working on zkVM and benchmarking STFs using OpenVM, with proposals expected next week
- **Zisk Exploration**: Additional team member investigating Zisk as alternative zkVM solution

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Complete coordination work on post-quantum testnet plan, finish hanging gossipsub tasks, and circulate PQ testnet proposal for review
- **Kolby**: Finalize forward syncer implementation and testing, begin head syncer development pending PQ testnet development
- **Kayden**: Complete blob sidecar gossip issue implementation
- **Varun**: Wrap up Beacon block gossip validation, implement comprehensive tests, and start peer scoring work
- **Shariq**: Finalize voluntary exit implementation with safety considerations and bulk operation confirmation prompts
- **Patchy**: Complete integration testing setup and Kurtosis configuration for testnet deployment readiness
- **Jun**: Address beacon state hash tree root performance issue
- **Dimitri**: Resolve current zkVM implementation bug and publish project proposals for team review
