# Ream Meeting #7 Recap

## Overview

The Technical Presentation meeting focused on the Ethereum Consensus Specifications, featuring a Unnawut who provided an introductory overview based on recent studies. Key topics included the foundational components of Ethereum consensus, such as the deposit contract, P2P networking, serialization, cryptography, consensus mechanisms, fork choice, and the relevant APIs. The discussion also detailed historical and upcoming Ethereum consensus releases, highlighting milestones like the Beacon chain genesis, the transition to Proof of Stake during the Merge, and future forks like Electra and Fulu. The session concluded with insights on navigating the consensus specifications and emphasized the significance of understanding the releases to facilitate effective engagement with the material.

## Notes

### Introduction to Ethereum Consensus Specs
- Unnawut presents an overview of Ethereum consensus specifications
- Disclaimer: Unnawut's knowledge is based on less than a month of study
- Overview covers structure and artifacts of consensus layer specs
- Topics to be covered: Ethereum specs, consensus components, releases, navigation, and spec tests

### Components of Ethereum Consensus
- Deposit contract: Acknowledges staking ETH
- P2P networking: Client instance communication
- Serialization: Data compression and communication
- Cryptography: Signing information
- Consensus: Validator agreement, RANDAO, committee selection
- Fork choice: Decision-making process
- APIs: Beacon API, Engine API, execution layer integration

### Ethereum Consensus Releases
- Phase Zero (December 2020): Beacon chain genesis, fundamental aspects
- Altair (2021): Introduced sync committees, increased penalties, first hard fork after genesis
- Bellatrix (2022): The Merge, transition to Proof of Stake, full penalties implemented
- Capella (April 2023): Staking withdrawals, EIP-4844 (Proto-danksharding)

#### Upcoming forks:
- Electra (Early 2025): Max expected balance, validator merging, increased blob throughput
- Fulu (Late 2025): PBS and Ethereum object format

### Navigating Consensus Specs
- Two main repos: consensus specs and consensus-specs-tests
- Importance of understanding releases for effective navigation
