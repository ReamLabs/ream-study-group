# Ream Meeting #27 Recap

## Overview

The meeting opened with interesting observations about Ethereum's validator queue spike to almost 400,000 ETH (requiring 7-day wait times) and client diversity concerns, with Lighthouse now commanding 42% and Teku commanding 53% market share according to Miga Labs and Rated Network respectively.

Key developments included significant progress on the validator client implementation, P2P networking improvements enabling multi-peer block downloads, and a major breakthrough with the zkVM integration using a workaround for 64-bit list limitations.

The team also received extensive updates from Justin on post-quantum cryptography research progress and upcoming organizational changes at the Ethereum Foundation.

## Development Progress

### Validator Client Implementation

- **Block Operations**: Shariq completed implementation of block fetching, signing, publishing flows and attestation submission. Two PRs submitted with one already merged, enabling block proposals and aggregated attestations once slot/epoch handling is complete.
- **Sync Committee Duties**: Patchy worked on splitting sync committee tasks between aggregator and non-aggregator roles, implemented clock intervals for fine-tuned control useful for attestation aggregation.

### P2P Networking and Syncing

- **Peer Connections**: Kolby fixed multiple networking issues including status message sending, ping/pong handling, and metadata exchange. Now successfully connecting to 5-7 peers.
- **Forward Sync Progress**: Implemented primitive forward syncing capability with parallel block downloads from multiple peers. Consolidated from three Tokyo runtimes to one for better resource management.
- **Request-Response Fixes**: Resolved message decoding bugs and buffer management issues in the networking stack.

### Gossip and Data Management

- **Subnet Assignment**: Kayden made progress on correct subnet assignment for gossip topics, waiting on Mercy's PR merge for completion.
- **Blob Storage**: Successfully moved blob storage from database to data directory with proper pruning implementation.

### Builder Integration and Infrastructure

- **MEV-Boost Support**: Varun implemented builder specifications with basic framework, next focusing on validator integration design.
- **Account Management**: Partha's basic account manager merged, now refactoring hashsig library for Ream compatibility in collaboration with Jihoon.

### zkVM Integration Breakthrough

- **64-bit Workaround**: Unnawut managed to ZK-process all process_block operations, except for processing execution payload which requires an EL client interaction, and producing matching state roots. This workaround is through the use of magic number conversion from 2^29 to 2^40 lists while computing the root.
- **State Transition Verification**: Benchmark repo now successfully compares zkVM and host execution results across all process_block operations except process_execution_payload.
- **Execution Payload Strategy**: Clarified with Justin that execution layer verification stays outside zkVM scope, with consensus layer trusting execution client responses.

### Research and External Updates

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Justin reported major progress with Winternitz signature optimization (30% improvement, Crypto conference acceptance), ongoing hash function security analysis, and 445-line verifier specification.
- **EF Reorganization**: New Protocol team structure with 80% short-term focus (scaling) and 20% long-term, transitioning from "Beam Chain" to "Lean Consensus Layer" terminology.

## Next Steps

- **Shariq**: Complete slot/epoch handling for validator client, coordinate with Partha on hashtag library integration
- **Jun**: Resume active contribution post-semester completion, continue zkVM abstraction work
- **Patchy**: Resolve sync committee slot timing questions, advance sync committee implementation
- **Kolby**: Implement primitive forward synker, focus on transition from forward sync to head-of-chain tracking
- **Kayden**: Complete subnet assignment implementation once dependencies merge, finalize blob pruning
- **Varun**: Integrate builder specs with validator code, progress on validator constraints and parallel issues
- **Partha**: Collaborate with Jihoon on hashtag library refactoring, coordinate validator integration planning
- **Unnawut**: Take a break from zkVM to contribute to Ream codebase for at least 1 week. Then back to tackle remaining STF operations (slots/epochs) and execution payload processing
