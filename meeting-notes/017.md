# Ream Meeting #17 Recap

## Overview

The call began with a brief discussion about the latest beam call on P2P, noting that many aspects are still in flux. The team then proceeded with status updates from each contributor. Key topics included progress on fork choice implementation, Beacon APIs, checkpoint syncing, zkVM integration challenges, and P2P discovery work. Several new participants joined the call, showing growing interest in the Ream project.

## Development Progress

### Client Development
- **Kolby**: Focused on reviewing PRs and working on a minimal viable product for the Request/Response domain
- **Kayden**: Completed implementing the Deneb fork choice spec and other fork choice specs; working on implementing tests and adapting the fork choice to use the database instead of an in-memory store
- **Varun**: Implemented several Beacon API endpoints (some pending review); shifting focus to checkpoint syncing which will be a significant milestone for Ream
- **Aditya**: Implemented the Beacon APIs attestation (recently approved); plans to implement more APIs starting with rewards

### P2P Networking
- **Partha**: Started work on peer management; will continue developing and submit a PR soon
- **Vineet**: Working on Discv5 discovery attestation subnet bitfield; has completed specs reading and is currently implementing based on Lighthouse code
- The team discussed various P2P research presented in [Beam Call #3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJkuwuh2Nrs) including gossipsub, gossipsub v2, and generalized gossipsub
- Some discussion about QUIC protocol usage - the team noted that Lighthouse prioritizes QUIC over TCP and adds a QUIC field in the ENR

### zkVM
- **Unnawut**: Got the merkle tree proving and verification working for validator registry, but encountered a 32-bit limitation in zkVMs that prevents fitting the validator registry index
  - The RiscZero team mentioned in a Discord chat from July 2024 that 64-bit support was coming by the end of that year, but Unnawut hasn't seen it implemented yet
  - Looking into other zkVMs, but none appear to support 64-bit operations. This will be a major bottleneck for snarkifying the "beacon" chain
  - The workaround is to pass specific validators into the zkVM and process with that, though this wouldn't guarantee data integrity as it skips Merkle proof verification, so it won't be production quality
  - Anyone with experience on 64-bit to 32-bit conversion are very welcomed to help tackle this issue
- **Jun** and **Unnawut** discussed zkVM options, noting that the implementation between SP1 and RiscZero is not significantly different as they both use the Ream codebase for state transitions. Adapters and interfaces can be implemented to pick different zkVMs within Ream

## Next Steps
- Kolby: Develop a minimal viable product for the request-response domain
- Kayden: Wrap up fork choice implementation and testing
- Varun: Complete checkpoint syncing to enable fast synchronization with the chain
- Aditya: Continue implementing Beacon APIs
- Partha: Implement peer management work
- Vineet: Implement Discv5 discovery
- Unnawut: Wrap up the zkVM tasks by proving what's currently possible, complete pending benchmarks, and write a dev log for the entire process
