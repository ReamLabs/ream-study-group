# Ream Meeting #16 Recap

## Overview

The team provided updates on their ongoing work on the Ream implementation, focusing primarily on the consensus layer client development. Key areas of progress include SSZ bytes streaming, p2p stack, Beacon API implementation, Deneb fork choice, and infrastructure improvements. The team also discussed on an upcoming Beam Day event before EthCC in Cannes in June.

## Development Progress

- **SSZ bytes streaming (Unnawut):** Continuing work on SSZ bytes streaming based on code from ethereum_ssz and Grandine's implementation. Still much to do, but will continue focusing on this area.
- **P2P stack (Kolby):** Made significant progress understanding the request/response domain of the p2p stack and has a clear implementation plan. Will have more time to dedicate to the project as university classes will be completed soon.
- **Beacon API (Varun):** Started implementation of the Beacon API with one endpoint already merged. Focus will be on implementing remaining endpoints based on priority, including stateful endpoints.
- **Database structure (Kolby & Varun):** Discussion about updating database tables to support various state ID types (slot numbers, hashes) for the Beacon API, with plans to implement tables for indexes and optimize lookup paths.
- **Deneb fork choice (Kayden):** Continuing work on implementing the Deneb fork choice. Progress has been slower than expected due to complex new concepts, but learning a lot and expects to complete it soon.
- **Dockerization (Partha):** Submitted a PR for dockerizing the Ream executable, currently under review. Also doing self-study work on RIBLT but not yet ready to push to the repository.

## Onboarding and Community

- New participant Aditya joined and inquired about architecture diagrams and documentation to understand data flow and design implementation.
  - Discussed the self-driven nature of L1 ecosystem development and recommended reading existing implementations like Lighthouse to understand structure.
  - Suggestion to look at EPF Study Group's YouTube video on consensus layer clients as a starting point.

## Team Building

- Jihoon suggested having regular friendly chats (30-45 minutes) before meetings for team members to get to know each other better and build teamwork. Discussed the possibility of arranging a separate meeting for this purpose.

## Upcoming Events

- Beam Day event planned for June 29th (day before ECC in Cannes) with around 60 attendees.
- Focus will be on the social layer and current progress with beam clients.
- Invitation for team members to attend and connect with existing consensus client teams.
- Discussion about finalizing the project name before the event, with current challenges being legal rather than consensus-based.

## Next Steps

1. Continue development in assigned areas:
  - SSZ bytes streaming (Unnawut)
  - Beacon API implementation (Varun)
  - Deneb fork choice (Kayden)
  - RIBLT research (Partha)
  - P2P stack (Kolby)
2. Update database tables to support different state ID types for Beacon API (Kolby & Varun)
3. Arrange team-building sessions per Jihoon's suggestion (Unnawut & Jihoon)
