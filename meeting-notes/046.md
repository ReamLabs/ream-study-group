# Ream Meeting #46 Recap

## Overview

This week's meeting had a smaller attendance due to DevConnect, with several team members attending the conference. The team continues to make progress on core implementation work, including attestation processing, fork choice logic, and metrics implementation. Two new participants joined the meeting, expressing interest in contributing to the project through testing and implementation work.

## Development Progress

### Lean Spec and Attestation Processing

- **Process Attestation Implementation**: Unnawut completed converting the markdown into the Python Lean spec but discovered issues with justification not working as expected. The problem stems from proposer attestations being handled differently from attester attestations - attesters use signed attestation while proposers use signed block with attestation, causing proposer attestations to be missing from fork choice. For the devnet, this shouldn't be critical as justification can still occur with the remaining attestations from other validators.
- **EPF Benchmark**: Unnawut ran benchmark operations for EPF fellows for Risero, SP1, and OpenVM to support their presentations.

### Fork Choice and Signing

- **Fork Choice Implementation**: Kayden completed implementing the fork choice logic, which initially had finalization problems due to incorrectly updated process attestations function. After fixes, finalization is working again.
- **Signing and Verification**: Kayden implemented signing and verifying functionality and updated the fork choice implementation to match spec changes that consolidated two functions into existing logic.

### Metrics and Testing

- **Signature Type Update**: Varun merged a PR changing the default signature type from hash sig's internal struct to fixed bytes to ensure compatibility with encode, decode, entry, hash, and hashseek requirements.
- **Node Bug Fix**: Varun identified a bug preventing the Ream/Lean node from starting and opened a PR, which was superseded by Kolby's PR with additional tests.
- **Metrics Implementation**: Varun implemented lean metrics across two PRs. Shariq also opened a consolidated PR covering the same functionality, which Varun reviewed after closing his PRs.
- **Test Implementation**: Varun is currently working on implementing tests from the specs.

### New Participant Onboarding

- **New Contributors**: Derek and Muhtasim joined as new participants, both interested in contributing to test implementation and familiarizing themselves with the codebase.
- **Repository Guidance**: Unnawut directed new contributors to focus on the Ream repo and Lean spec repo, noting that consensus tests should be prioritized over unit tests, as the latter are being deprecated.

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Continue work on the proposer attestation issue in the leanspec
- **Kayden**: Continue work on fork choice implementation
- **Varun**: Continue implementing tests from the specs
