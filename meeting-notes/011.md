# Ream Meeting #11 Recap

## Overview
The meeting focused on development progress across multiple workstreams, including ef-test integration, zkSTF development, and project management structuring. Key highlights include ongoing bug fixes in the process block function, work on attestation data, and the establishment of a formal project management structure.


## Ream Client - Testing and Integration
- Jun and Kolby are working on ef-test integration
  - Multiple bugs discovered and being addressed
  - Decision made to divide operation tasks into separate PRs
  - Currently lacking unit tests; need to establish sufficient test coverage for zkSTF benchmarking
  - Identified critical endian-related issue in shuffle index implementation

## State transition function
- Varun: Worked on and will continue working on attestation data function implementation
- Kolby: Supporting bug fixes and working on SSZ and operation tests
- Kayden: Successfully merged 3 consensus functions; working on process execution payload

## zkSTF Development

- SP1 and Risc0 PoCs temporarily blocked by process block function issues
- Unnawut is working on understanding state transition functions from Beam Chain perspective and Justin's suggestion on stateless state reads/writes

## Project Management

- Check out the project board at https://github.com/orgs/ReamLabs/projects/1/views/1. The board should require minimal maintenance since it's automatically sorted based on issue properties
- Issue labels so that we can filter our domains easily:
  - Consensus
  - Cryptography
  - Networking
  - ZK Proving
- Other labels: p0, p1, p2, p3 labels for priorities (p0 is highest)
- "Good first issue" label: The team will label this to attract new contributors but will need everyone's help creating and tagging the label
- Projects: Only "Ream Client" project for now. Needed for the issue to show up on the project board.
- Milestones: Based on calendar quarter so it's easy to track the progress and todos per quarter using the milestones. Check out the milestones at https://github.com/ReamLabs/ream/milestones
- Meta issues: Create meta issues to keep track of the objectives we want to achieve each quarter. The issue should contain acceptance criteria of the things we want done to be able to say we've completed the milestone

## Other items

- Discussion about Beam Chain's naming conflicts - deemed not immediate concern

## Next Steps

- Kolby & Jun: Continue bug fixing and adding unit tests to the codebase to increase test coverage
- Kayden & Varun: Continue to work on state transition functions
- Unnawut: Explore stateless state reads/writes in zkSTF and consider extending [Stackr's zkvm benchmark](https://github.com/stackrlabs/succinct-residency-exps) to include [Brevis's Pico](https://blog.brevis.network/2025/02/11/introducing-pico-a-modular-and-performant-zkvm/)
- Jun & Unnawut: Resume zk PoCs after process block function fixes
