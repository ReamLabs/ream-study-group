# Ream Meeting #22 Recap

## Overview

This week's meeting covered progress updates from team members working on different aspects of the Ream implementation. Key developments included P2P layer implementation for beacon blocks and blobs, zkVM interface improvements for beacon state transitions, checkpoint sync updates, and OpenVM benchmarking experiments. The team also discussed upcoming milestones for running full nodes and the upcoming BeamCall on three-slot finality.

## Development Progress

**P2P Layer Implementation**: Kolby completed the Req/Resp P2P implementation for beacon blocks and blobs. He's now researching how to organize the various services that need P2P access, including block syncing and gossip topic handling. A planning call with Kayden and Varun is scheduled to design the overall architecture.

**SSZ Type System**: Unnawut focused on internal organization and continued investigating SSZ type issues, particularly the challenge of modifying SSZ types to use u64 instead of usize for handling lists up to 2^40 elements. This change impacts multiple dependencies including Ethereum SSZ, creating type compatibility issues across the codebase.

**Test Implementation and Config Support**: Kayden finished implementing finality and random test macros and is currently working on sync tests. He's also adding support for reading config YAML files into the network spec code in the repository.

**zkVM State Transition Interface**: Jun investigated the interface for passing beacon state to the zkVM, implementing a builder pattern inspired by the alloy codebase. He created a minimal implementation for the process slashing reset function and is working on handling large lists (validators, balances) with proper deserialization inside the zkVM.

**Checkpoint Sync**: Varun updated his checkpoints PR, fixing failing EF tests and network tests caused by recent refactoring. Checkpoint sync initialization should be completed within the next day or two, after which he'll begin work on the weak subjectivity period implementation.

**OpenVM Benchmarking**: Mercy experimented with OpenVM benchmarking against their current RISC Zero implementation. Initial results showed OpenVM performing better across attestation, block header, and sync aggregate operations, with a 1.82x improvement in cycle rates and better proof sizes. She encountered technical difficulties with her laptop but plans to share the codebase for team review.

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Continue resolving SSZ type issues with 64-bit usize
- **Kolby**: Continue P2P architecture research
- **Kayden**: Complete sync test implementation and finish config YAML file support
- **Jun**: Implement deserialization for large lists inside zkVM and open PR for multi-proof functionality
- **Varun**: Complete checkpoint sync PR merge and begin weak subjectivity period implementation
- **Mercy**: Share OpenVM benchmarking codebase for team review and optimization suggestions
