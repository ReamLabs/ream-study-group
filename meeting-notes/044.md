# Ream Meeting #44 Recap

## Overview

The team continued progress on multiple fronts including Lean Spec development, test vectors integration, zkVM proof generation, and devnet infrastructure. Several members are balancing current development work with upcoming EPF obligations and DevConnect preparations. The team also discussed plans to launch a study group covering technical topics like Koala Bear prime field, Poseidon2 hash function, Winternitz OTS, and XMSS, which will begin after DevConnect to allow for better preparation and participation.

## Development Progress

### Lean Spec and Testing

- **Lean Spec Reviews**: Unnawut conducted reviews on signature containers and test vectors. He's now tackling more complex test cases and identified issues with fork choice logic when chains become justified beyond slot 0.
- **Test Vector Integration**: Varun merged PRs for removing validator config types and updating block/SSZ structures for devnet1. He plans to begin integrating test vectors into Ream, though Unnawut warned the vectors may need framework-side fixes before working properly with the client.
- **Spec Repository Cleanup**: Varun contributed general cleanup and PR reviews to the spec repository.

### Hash Signatures and Metrics

- **Hash Signature Interface**: Shariq completed work on a new hash signature interface and fixed a make PR issue that was causing performance problems with the big signature scheme test. He's evaluating whether to keep the prepare signature function separate or integrate it into the sign function.
- **Key Generation Performance**: The team discussed concerns about key generation times. This raises questions about generating keys for larger validator sets in future devnets.
- **Metrics Implementation**: Shariq expects to submit a PR for metrics work this week.
- **Key Storage**: Kayden completed a PR adding functionality for storing and recovering hash signature key pairs, and is working on designing and verifying block attestations.

### zkVM Proof Generation

- **Proof Verification Refactoring**: Dimitris and Utsav discovered architectural issues with their proof verification implementation in the LeanChainService module. The current approach blocks execution and prevents slot justification from progressing. They're refactoring to create a dedicated proof service instead.
- **Docker Environment Issues**: Utsav encountered problems with proof generation failing inside Docker environments and is awaiting connection with someone from RiscZero through Mario.
- **Benchmark Updates**: Utsav plans to update the Ream zkVM benchmarks for Beacon State to support OpenVM proof generation by Friday, allowing team members to run tests on various hardware configurations.
- **EPF Deadline**: Both Dimitris and Utsav are prioritizing EPF presentation and documentation work, which needs to be completed within approximately one week.

### Devnet Infrastructure

- **Kurtosis Development**: Jun created a new repository for a Kurtosis package for the pqdevnet, porting Docker Compose scripts and shell scripts into Starlark files. He expects completion this week and will share links in the PQInterop Telegram group. The package will be lighter than Ethereum's Panda Ops version, focusing on single-machine deployment initially.
- **Infrastructure Decisions**: The team clarified that Docker Compose and Kurtosis are designed for single-machine devnets. Multi-host cloud deployment would require Kubernetes integration or tools like Ansible, which Jun plans to investigate further for future needs.

### Study Group Planning

- **Topic Selection**: The team decided to postpone the study group launch until after DevConnect. Dimitris volunteered to present on Koala Bear prime field, and Jun will cover Poseidon2 hash function.
- **Presentation Format**: Individual presentations will vary in length (5-30+ minutes) depending on topic complexity. Simple topics like Koala Bear may only need 10 minutes, while VM or multisig topics could require 30+ minutes.
- **Revisiting Previous Topics**: The team agreed it would be valuable to revisit zkWinternitz and zkXMSS in layman's terms.

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Continue Lean Spec reviews and fork choice test development
- **Jun**: Continue Kurtosis package development; share links in Telegram; prepare Poseidon2 presentation for post-DevConnect study group
- **Varun**: Begin test vector integration work; continue spec repository contributions
- **Shariq**: Submit PRs for hash signature interface and metrics; evaluate signature preparation approach; run key generation benchmarks overnight; test zkVM benchmarks when ready
- **Dimitris**: Refactor proof verification into dedicated proof service; complete EPF presentation and documentation; prepare Koala Bear field presentation
- **Utsav**: Follow up with Mario on RiscZero connection for Docker issues; refactor proof verification architecture; update Ream zkVM benchmarks with OpenVM by Friday
- **Kayden**: Continue work on block attestation design and verification
