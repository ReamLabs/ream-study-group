# Ream Meeting #18 Recap

## Overview

The meeting primarily consisted of development progress updates across different workstreams. Justin Drake shared information about upcoming events including calls on https://ethresear.ch/t/adding-flexibility-to-ethereums-exit-queue/22061, https://ethproofs.org/, APS, and 3SF related to the Beam Chain. Kolby noted the significant growth in contributor numbers, with approximately 7-10 new people joining over the past two weeks.

## Development Progress

- Kolby: Continuing work on an initial request-response domain peer-to-peer implementation.
- Kayden: Completed macro implementation but still working to fix code to make tests pass. Will address Jihoon's review comments next.
- Varun: Researched checkpoint sync and general syncing approaches. Plans to open a draft PR within a few days and complete checkpoint sync implementation this week.
- Unnawut: Completed RISC Zero initial benchmarks. Some findings:
  - Investigated whether zkVM can successfully run state transition functions and analyzed cycle requirements
  - Found differences from SP1 implementation, noting he could not yet get RISC Zero to handle 2^40 size lists for the validator registry
  - Implemented a workaround by reducing list size to 2^30, though this makes it non-conformant with Beacon specs
  - Benchmark results showed RISC Zero takes more cycles to read pre-state but fewer cycles for transition functions. Although he questions if the cycles could be compared across zkVMs
  - Early returns for negative test cases unexpectedly didn't reduce cycles significantly
  - Suggested SP1 offers an easier path forward without major roadblocks

## New Contributors:

- Veer is contributing to API implementation
- Yuttakhan opened a PR for Beacon API work
- Mercy is working through implementation issues with Ethereum SSZ

## Next Steps

- Kolby: Continue work on request-response domain peer-to-peer implementation and help Mercy debug her issues.
- Kayden: Fix code to make tests pass and address Jihoon's review comments.
- Varun: Complete checkpoint sync implementation and open a draft PR.
- Unnawut: Wrap up partial SSZ work and write development notes on it.
