# Ream Meeting #54 Recap

## Overview

The team continued progress on devnet stability and testing infrastructure while preparing for the year ahead. Several client teams have recently joined the Lean consensus effort, with Grandine announcing and open sourcing their Lean consensus client. The project is entering a planning phase to refine the roadmap for 2026, balancing near-term devnet goals with longer-term research items like post-quantum cryptography and snarkification. Discussions highlighted ongoing work on networking reliability, metrics implementation, and synchronization improvements across different client implementations.

## Development Progress

### Client Development and Testing

- **Pruning Code**: Kolby improved robustness of pruning code after issue report, though unable to replicate the original problem locally
- **Finalization Testing**: Added new test with three separate nodes each running one validator to better simulate multi-node scenarios
- **Syncing Implementation**: Kolby continued work on syncing code
- **Snappy Encoding**: Kayden submitted PR for snappy encoding all database values
- **EF Tests**: Kayden updated EF tests to Fulu and updated protocol ID

### Metrics and Monitoring

- **New Metrics**: Shariq completed implementation of node start time, node info, fork choice, and finalization metrics
- **Aggregated Signatures**: Shariq is working on a PR for aggregated signatures
- **Safe Target Slot**: Katya proposed new metric for tracking attestation targets, pending team review. Planning to change PQ signatures prefix to "pqsig" for brevity

### Networking and DevNet Status

- **Peer Redial Mechanism**: Katya identified issues with peer reconnection when connections are lost; Kolby to investigate and potentially add automatic redialing
- **Devnet Client Status**: Zeam attempting sync, Qlean and Lantern in progress, Lighthouse fixing issues, Ream syncing not available yet
- **Connection Issues**: Some clients dropping connection attempts before genesis, leading to potential finality issues

### Performance Optimization

- **PQ Key Generation**: Unnawut looking into PRs to speed up key generation process (currently taking 2.5 days)

### leanroadmap.org website

- **Lean Roadmap Website**: Unnawut completed a refresh including leanSig and Lean multisig benchmarks, new research tracks, updated resources, and minor UI updates
- **DevNet 3 Planning**: Gathered discussions from chats into a shared document with merged PR, still accepting changes

### Research and Education

- **Study group sessions**: Unnawut planning to work through backlogged study group sessions
- **Koala Bear prime field sharing**: Dimitris working on first talk for study group

## Next Steps

- **Kolby**: Investigate and implement peer redial mechanism; continue syncing code development
- **Shariq**: Complete aggregated signatures PR and aggregation metrics
- **Kayden**: Focus on preparing and delivering talk; continue beacon PR work
- **Unnawut**: Submit PRs to optimize PQ key generation speed; work through study group sessions
- **Katya**: Test new Ream syncing image; update PQ signatures prefix; finalize safe target slot metric proposal
- **Dimitris**: Prepare first KoalaBear study group talk
- **Ladislaus**: Conduct internal planning meetings for 2026 roadmap; coordinate with EF discussions in Berlin
