# Ream Meeting #57 Recap

## Overview

The team discussed syncing robustness, leanSpec updates, devnet-3 preparation, and test infrastructure improvements. Development efforts centered on making Ream's syncing transition near the chain head more reliable, porting updated spec tests to the client, and adding API testing capabilities to the leanSpec. The team also highlighted an upcoming PQ transaction signatures breakout session following the PQ interop call.

## Development Progress

### Syncing Robustness

- **Head syncing reliability**: Kolby has been researching how to make the transition from syncing to following the chain head more robust. While Ream has performed well on devnets so far, testing has revealed some reliability issues during the transition period. Work is focused on identifying bottlenecks such as handling large attestation or block payloads with massive signatures and exploring optimizations like queuing gossiped messages to smooth the transition.

### LeanSpec and Testing

- **Spec test alignment**: Shariq worked on getting updated spec tests from the leanSpec to match in the client, with a PR expected imminently.
- **API testing framework**: Unnawut added API testing capabilities to the leanSpec, allowing automated testing of client endpoints for coverage, correct Accept headers, content types, expected fields, and field types. The framework intentionally ignores actual content values since those vary by genesis and state, focusing instead on formatting correctness to help resolve lengthy interop discrepancies.
- **leanSpec aggregation review**: Unnawut reviewed the leanSpec aggregation PR, with a new update requiring one more review pass.

### devnet-3 Preparation

- **Spec review**: Both Shariq and Kayden have been reading the devnet-3 spec to prepare for upcoming implementation work, including committee aggregation.
- **PeerDAS EF test**: Kayden implemented the peerDAS EF test and is fixing related issues.

### Test Infrastructure

- **Test fixes**: Patchy has been catching up and fixing broken tests, with one already resolved and fixes for several others in progress locally. After completing test fixes, focus will shift to the p2p library.

### Contributor Work

- **Response chunks**: Derek continued working on the response chunks implementation, noting progress despite the complexity of the code involved. Kolby acknowledged the difficulty of the task, as it requires deep contextual understanding of particularly dense code.

## Next Steps

- **Kolby**: Continue syncing robustness research and share results on bottleneck optimizations
- **Shariq**: Submit spec test alignment PR; continue studying devnet-3 spec
- **Kayden**: Continue devnet-3 spec review and committee aggregation work; fix peerDAS-related issues
- **Unnawut**: Complete final review of leanSpec aggregation PR; study and share findings on WHIR; add SSZ encoding/decoding test vectors to leanSpec
- **Patchy**: Finish fixing remaining broken tests, then shift focus to p2p library
- **Derek**: Continue response chunks implementation
