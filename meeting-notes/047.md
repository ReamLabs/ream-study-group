# Ream Meeting #47 Recap

## Overview

The team held their regular sync with a mix of core contributors and new participants joining the discussion. Development continues on the Lean specification implementation with a focus on proposer attestations, interoperability testing, and resolving encoding/decoding issues with Zeam. With Shariq returning from DevConnect, the team is looking to create more good first issues to help onboard new contributors effectively.

## Development Progress

### Lean Spec Implementation

- **Proposer Attestation Issue**: Unnawut continued investigating why proposer attestations aren't being counted in fork choice. The state process block and fork choice functions are correctly taking attestations, but the proposer is attesting to unexpected source and target slots. The issue is causing test failures when the proposer's vote is needed to reach the 2/3 quorum threshold.
- **Signature Test Vectors**: Unnawut began exploring the creation of test vectors for signature-related code, with some questions remaining about Montgomery format support in Python that need to be investigated.

### Interoperability Testing

- **Ream-Zeam Integration**: Kolby and Kayden are working on interop testing between Ream, and Zeam. Current blockers include encoding/decoding issues where messages from Zeam over GossipSub are either much larger or smaller than expected, preventing attestation reception and finalization during interop.
- **Test Coverage**: The Lean spec has tests for encoding/decoding three common objects but lacks randomized tests. Kayden has been implementing updates from the Lean spec, standardizing the validator registry format, and adding tests to both Lean and Ream.

### Networking and Devnet

- **Devnet 2 Work**: Kolby has been working on status ping-pong functionality for devnet2 and helping debug various issues that arise during development.
- **Request-Response Implementation**: Kolby plans to implement request response message limit code next, with the requesting missing blocks case being deprioritized as it may not be a critical networking constraint.

### zkVM Compilation

- **Upstream Issue**: An issue with zkVM compilation flags needs to be addressed upstream in the new leanSig repo. Shariq will create a new issue with updated context when he returns to his computer.

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Continue debugging the proposer attestation issue and investigate Montgomery format support for signature test vectors
- **Kolby**: Implement request response message limit code and assist with Zema interop debugging
- **Kayden**: Continue interop testing between Grandine, Ream, and Zema
- **Shariq**: Create new issue in Lean SIG repo for zkVM compilation flags with updated context; create good first issues for new contributors
- **Mihir**: Continue reading through codebase and look for additional contribution opportunities
- **Derek**: Work on GossipSub testing and fork choice testing issues
