# Ream Meeting #55 Recap

## Overview

The team made significant progress on syncing capabilities and devnet-2 preparation. Syncing functionality was successfully tested with multi-node scenarios, including handling edge cases like peer timeouts and boot node reconnections. Work continued on porting aggregated attestations to Rust, implementing checkpoint sync, and improving test coverage. The team also addressed connection stability issues across different client implementations and began planning for devnet-3 development. Study group presentations are being prepared to share knowledge on leanISA, WHIR and SuperSpartan components.

## Development Progress

### Syncing and Network Connectivity

- **Multi-node Syncing**: Kolby successfully tested syncing with a three-node devnet-1, where nodes could reach chain head simultaneously and resume after shutdown
- **Edge Case Handling**: Kolby implemented timeout logic (2-second peer response timeout) and boot node reconnection for more robust syncing
- **Connection Stability Testing**: Katya tested syncing across multiple clients and identified disconnection issues after reconnection
- **Peer Metrics**: Discussion around adding inbound/outbound connection labels and peer identification metrics to better debug connection issues

### Devnet-2 Implementation

- **Aggregator Attestations**: Shariq ported aggregator attestations from leanSpec to Rust and is versioning spec tests to support both devnet-1 and devnet-2
- **CI Integration**: Shariq added CI for running spec tests and will finish metrics for aggregated attestations
- **Checkpoint Sync**: Kayden implemented checkpoint sync and updated state functions to latest spec with corresponding tests
- **Test Integration**: Kayden added devnet-2 tests to run on PR submissions

### Signature Validation and Finalization

- **Finalization Issues**: The team identified that Ream cannot currently finalize with itself due to signature validation errors
- **Planned Updates**: Kane plans to update leanVM and leanSig commits to finalized versions, which should resolve signature generation and validation issues
- **Test Vectors**: Discussion on ensuring adequate devnet-2 test coverage in test vectors

### leanSpec and Performance

- **Key Generation Optimization**: Unnawut submitted a PR to leanSpec to improve keygen time from 2 days to 8-10 hours by replacing Python objects with numpy arrays for Poseidon permute function
- **Fork Choice Tests**: Unnawut fixed fork choice tests and fork choice store time issues in leanSpec

### Study Group and Documentation

- **Presentation Preparation**: Unnawut is preparing slides on leanISA, WHIR and SuperSpartan for next week's study group session
- **KoalaBear Study**: Dmitris started looking at KoalaBear and will seek feedback from Unnawut
- **Devnet Checklist**: Mercy created a checklist for devnet progress tracking and deployment readiness

### Infrastructure and Deployment

- **Docker Tagging Strategy**: Kolby outlined the new docker tag approach for supporting multiple devnets (latest-devnet1, latest-devnet2, latest-devnet3)
- **Metrics Requirements**: Discussion on adding peer connection metrics (PR13) to devnet-2 requirements
- **Bug Fixes**: Jun fixed a small bug in checkpoint sync APIs; previously identified pruning logic issue was already resolved

### Code Cleanup

- **Fork Update**: Derek closed the Fulu fork update issue after determining continuous CL fork upgrades aren't necessary
- **Response Chunk Limit**: Derek is researching Request-Response protocols for the response chunk limit issue

## Next Steps

- **Kolby**: Monitor syncing robustness with new edge case handling, investigate connection issues with Katya
- **Shariq**: Complete spec test versioning, finish aggregated attestation metrics, investigate signature validation issues
- **Kayden**: Submit prepared talk, continue leanSpec work
- **Jun**: Continue ramping up on codebase
- **Unnawut**: Complete study group presentation slides for leanISA/SuperSpartan, review test vector coverage for devnet-2
- **Katya**: Test new Ream image with updated syncing logic, continue investigating peer connection stability, explore finality voting metrics
- **Mercy**: Gather feedback on devnet checklist, add PR13 peer connection metrics to requirements
- **Dmitris**: Complete KoalaBear study materials, get feedback from Unnawut, take over Utsav's project completion
- **Derek**: Continue research on Request-Response chunk limit implementation
