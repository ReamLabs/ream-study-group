# Ream Meeting #34 Recap

## Overview

The team discussed progress on the upcoming pqdevnet0 deployment, with significant work completed on networking infrastructure, metrics implementation, and consensus improvements. Key challenges included debugging finalization issues and timing-related consensus problems. The team also addressed standardization efforts for lean metrics across clients and discussed switching from Secp256k1 to Ed25519 for easier interoperability with the Zeam team. Development continues to focus on preparing for devnet0 with an emphasis on QUIC-only networking and minimal viable metrics implementation.

## Development Progress

### Networking & Infrastructure

- **Static Peer Connections**: Varun implemented manual peer list configuration allowing nodes to connect to predetermined peers for DevNet Zero, where all peer multi-addresses will be known in advance
- **RPC Services**: Varun completed head RPC service providing current lean chain head information and is developing peer RPC to monitor active node connections
- **QUIC-Only Protocol**: Varun successfully transitioned lean node to QUIC-only networking, removing TCP support entirely as required for DevNet Zero's design goals
- **Error Logging Improvements**: Varun enhanced debugging experience by providing clearer error messages for common configuration mistakes like setting genesis_time to zero

### Metrics & Monitoring

- **Infrastructure Setup**: Unnawut established foundational metrics system using Prometheus and Grafana with Docker Compose, implementing minimal histogram and slot-related metrics
- **Cross-Client Standardization**: Participated in Katya's initiative to create unified metrics standards across execution layer, beacon chain, and lean implementations, though specifications remain early-stage
- **Performance Validation**: Shariq successfully tested lean node stability, achieving 2000 continuous slots on PC and 1000 on MacBook with consistent finalization and flat performance graphs

### Consensus & Timing

- **Tick Synchronization Issues**: Jun identified critical timing bug where ticks fire milliseconds early, causing blocks to be assigned to previous slots and creating consensus failures across multiple machines
- **Slot Calculation Accuracy**: Jun discovered fundamental issue where interval-based slot counting will drift from system time over extended periods due to leap seconds, potentially causing network disagreement after 1.5 years
- **Consensus Debugging Efforts**: Team investigated widespread finalization stopping issues affecting Jun and Unnawut's nodes, though root cause remains unidentified

### Cryptography & Signatures

- **Post-Quantum Integration**: Shariq began structured implementation of signing and verification from hashtag library, following the successful pattern used for BLS integration
- **Signature Scheme Migration**: Team unanimously agreed to switch from SECP256k1 to ED25519 to reduce implementation burden on Zeam team, treating it as interim solution before full post-quantum deployment
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Mercy developed CLI wrapper around Rust key generation libraries to measure performance characteristics across different implementations

### zkVM Development

- **OpenVM Implementation**: Dimitris resolved his single attestation bugs and advanced host code development, though still experiencing panicking issues requiring resolution before PR submission

## Next Steps

- **Varun**: Complete peer RPC review process and identify next priority lean node implementation tasks
- **Shariq**: Submit PR for hash-based signing integration following structured BLS implementation pattern
- **Kayden**: Deliver gossip protocol implementation PR with full functionality by end of day
- **Dimitris**: Resolve remaining host code panicking issues to achieve framework-free single attestation capability
- **Jun**: Finalize tick timing fixes and document slot calculation concerns in lean specification PR comments
- **Unnawut**: Process daily devnet0 spec feedback and evaluate deployment tooling alternatives between Docker Compose and Kurtosis for multi-node testing
- **Mercy**: Complete key generation performance analysis and publish comprehensive benchmark results on HackMD platform
