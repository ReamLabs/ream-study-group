# Ream Meeting #42 Recap

## Overview

The team gathered for their regular status update meeting with focus on post-devnet0 activities and preparations for devnet1. Key developments include progress on Lean spec PR reviews, particularly around signature aggregation and test vector generation, as well as addressing zkVM compilation issues. The team is currently waiting for spec finalization before proceeding with several container implementation tasks for devnet1. Developer infrastructure improvements were made including documentation updates and CI pipeline fixes.

## Development Progress

### Lean Spec and Testing

- **Signature Aggregation Review**: Jun and Unnawut reviewed PRs related to block signature and aggregation in the Lean spec
- **Historical Block Hash Validations**: Shariq identified discrepancies between Ream's implementation and the spec regarding additional validations for historical block hashes that exist in Ream but not in the spec

### zkVM Integration

- **EPF Support**: Unnawut supported EPF efforts on zkVM implementation, working towards getting a zkVM proof inside the Lean client
- **Compilation Issues**: Shariq fixed CI pipeline failures related to zkVM compilation with Kolby's assistance, creating issues in Plonky3 and hashing repositories
- **Implementation Progress**: Dimitrios continuing work on zkVM implementation, aiming for a running prototype soon

### Devnet Updates

- **devnet1 Preparations**: Varun started implementing new containers for devnet1 but paused pending spec finalization
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Varun integrated the testing signature scheme from Hash Sig into Ream after it was previously removed

### Developer Infrastructure

- **Quick Start Documentation**: Shariq added a quick start document to the book with commands for running a node and references to the local pqdevnet repository
- **ENR Reload Logic**: Kayden implemented reload logic for within a given ENR
- **Validator Container**: Jun added validator container with public key compatibility for the current Lean state, implementing tree hash, encode/decode, and serialize/deserialize traits
- **UDP Implementation**: Jun noted that Quadrivium team reached out about scheduling with a PR open for patching UDP implementation dependencies

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Review test vector generation PR, complete and publish devnet0 summary, continue supporting zkVM integration efforts
- **Varun**: Review specs PR and implement container updates for devnet1 once specs are finalized
- **Shariq**: Continue developer infrastructure improvements, refactor local pqdevnet repository for better presentation
- **Kayden**: Continue reviewing PRs and studying Lean specs
- **Jun**: Handle UDP implementation PR review with Quadrium team coordination
- **Dimitrios**: Complete zkVM prototype implementation and review corrections from recent PRs
