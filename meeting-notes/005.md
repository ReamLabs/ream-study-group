# Ream Meeting #5 Recap

## Overview

The recent Ream developers call featured a comprehensive technical presentation on hash-based signature schemes, with Philipp Muens (@pmuens) opening the session by discussing the importance of post-quantum secure cryptography and the NIST standardization process. The meeting delved into various cryptographic concepts, beginning with an overview of asymmetric cryptography and a simple hash-based signature scheme for single-bit signing, while acknowledging its inefficiencies due to large key and signature sizes. Subsequently, the Lamport-Diffie One-Time Signature scheme was introduced, highlighting its optimization potential and inherent limitations. The discussion then transitioned to the Winternitz OTS scheme, presenting hash chains, parameter impacts, and checksum mechanisms to enhance security. A Q&A session followed, addressing recommended hash functions, the significance of 256-bit hashes, and the post-quantum security of these schemes. The meeting concluded with insights on implementing the Winternitz OTS in the beam chain and optimizing performance for signature verification.
