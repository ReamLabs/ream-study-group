# Ream Meeting #9 Recap

## Overview

In today's meeting, Partha shared about Maximum Extractable Value (MEV), its implications, and various mitigation strategies, including Proposer Builder Separation and mechanisms on Layer 2s and alternative Layer 1s. Updates on the REAM codebase were presented by Varun Doshi, highlighting new features such as slashing functions and peer discovery enhancements. Unnawut shared insights from zkVM implementation, pinpointing pre-state reading as the most time-consuming operation during benchmarking. The meeting concluded with plans for future discussions, including a review of a recently released post quantum signature white paper, and assigned action items for team members focusing on unit tests, benchmarking, and white paper implementation specifics.

## MEV sharing

### MEV Explanation and Strategies
- Parthasarathy Ramanujam explained Maximum Extractable Value (MEV)
- Discussed negative effects of MEV: network congestion, failed transactions
- Explored positive effects and mitigation strategies
- Explained Proposer Builder Separation (PBS) and Builder API

### MEV Mitigation on L2s and Alt L1s
- Discussed Arbitrum's Time Boost proposal
- Explained Polygon's Fastlane for MEV mitigation
- Covered Optimism's MEV Auction (Meva) setup
- Explored MEV on Solana, Aptos, and Sui

### Account Abstraction and 4337 Alt Mempool
- Explained account abstraction concept and smart contract wallets
- Discussed 4337 Alt Mempool proposal and its implementation
- Covered bundlers and their role in mitigating MEV risks

### FOCIL and MEV
- Jihoon added that FOCIL does not impact MEV. FOCIL does not enforce any order so there's no value created and believed that there will not be an inclusion list market

## Project updates

### REAM Codebase Updates
- Varun Doshi presented updates on the REAM codebase
  - Implemented the process block header function to add new block headers to the validator list, ensuring checks for slot matching and proposer slashing.
  - He also developed the process slashing function to verify malicious actions by proposers and execute slashing if necessary.
  - Additional functions are in progress, with a target set for next week to establish unit tests for the codebase.
- Kolby working on peer discovery for peer-to-peer layer
- Kayden implemented withdrawals and deposit functions

### zkVM Implementation and Benchmarking
- Unnawut experimented with zkVM implementation on risc0
  - Created beacon state and block from consensus spec test
  - Benchmarked cycle counts for reading pre-state, reading block, and processing block header
  - Identified reading pre-state as the most time-consuming operation
- Jun was able achieve [similar progress with Succint's SP1](https://hackmd.io/@reamlabs/BJ5xw0h_ke)

## Action items
- Varun Doshi: Implement unit tests for the REAM codebase by next week
- Unnawut: Continue benchmarking and work on the runtime with Jun
- Philipp: Prepare to cover the implementation specifics from the white paper in the next session
