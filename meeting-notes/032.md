# Ream Meeting #32 Recap

## Overview

The team hit a major milestone this week with the successful integration of the 3SF implementation into the main Ream codebase, marking a pivotal shift from theoretical work to practical lean chain development. With this foundation in place, the entire team is now pivoting toward building the pqdevnet infrastructure. Work is underway on architecting a clean, channel-based validator service, while development efforts transition from beacon chain work to tackle new validator challenges.

Meanwhile, the EPF fellows are adapting their zkVM benchmarking efforts to focus on the lean consensus work rather than beacon state processing. The meeting revealed both the momentum building around lean chain development and the technical challenges ahead, particularly around multi-validator node support and PQ signature integration that will be crucial for the upcoming PQ devnet launch.

## Development Progress

### 3SF Implementation
- **Migration Completed**: Unnawut finished migrating the 3SF implementation from standalone codebase into Ream with thorough PR reviews from Jun and Kolby
- **Testing Strategy**: Plans to add unit tests for the 3SF implementation, particularly for process block functionality

### Lean Chain Architecture
- **Validator Service Design**: Jun working on separating staker responsibilities and creating a beacon chain struct for lean chain with simple MPSC channel-based communication
- **Duties Assignment**: Round-robin block proposal system where validator ID determines proposer slot (slot number divided by validator count)
- **Multi-validator Support**: Need to extend 3SF mini to support multiple validators per node for proper network testing

### P2P Networking
- **Peer Management**: Kayden implemented improvements for peer disconnection handling and connected peer filtering
- **Network Focus**: Shifting full attention to lean chain P2P development

### zkVM Benchmarking
- **OpenVM Integration**: Dimitris working on running examples and integrating with existing SP1/RISC0 frameworks
- **Jolt and Pico Progress**: Utsav made progress with Jolt execution but waiting on profiling features; encountering errors with Pico beacon state input
- **Scope Pivot**: Both EPF fellows transitioning from beacon state benchmarking to 3SF implementation for lean chain

### PQ Signatures
- **Implementation Status**: Partha working on PQ signature integration with temporary empty signatures for validation skipping

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Add unit tests for 3SF implementation, work on specs for containers and gossip sub messages for PQ devnet
- **Kayden**: Shift full focus to lean chain development
- **Shariq**: Move completely to lean client validator work, wait for Jun's validator service architecture
- **Jun**: Complete validator service architecture design and create PR for team review and feedback
- **Dimitris**: Resolve cargo dependency issues with OpenVM, post questions to team chat for assistance
- **Utsav**: Continue Jolt and Pico work while transitioning to lean 3SF implementation
- **Mercy**: Continue working on previous issues
- **Team**: Review meta tracking issue for PQ devnet and add missing work items
