# Meeting Summary: zkBeam Study Group

## Overview

This meeting primarily featured a study group presentation on SSZ (Simple Serialize) in Ethereum consensus layer, followed by weekly updates from team members. The discussion focused on optimizing state transitions in zkVMs, particularly regarding serialization and merkleization techniques. Justin Drake provided insights on validator identification and state transition optimization for zkBeam.

## Simple Serialize (SSZ) Presentation by Unnawut

- What is SSZ (Simple Serialize)
  - A serialization method for transferring data across networks
  - Used in Ethereum's consensus layer to compress and merkleize the beacon state
  - Helps all validators share the same view of consensus state by comparing Merkle roots

- SSZ vs RLP
  - RLP (Recursive Length Prefix) is used in the execution layer
  - SSZ was designed specifically for the consensus layer
  - SSZ has limited primitive types (unsigned integers, bytes, booleans) and composite types
  - SSZ is schema-less, requiring knowledge of the schema in advance
  - SSZ is designed to be easily merkleized, unlike RLP

- Merkleization in SSZ
  - Data is divided into 32-byte chunks
  - Chunks are paired and merkleized recursively to create a single Merkle root
  - SSZ also allows for efficient summaries and expansions
  - Example: `BeaconBlockHeader` contains only `body_root`, but can be expanded into `BeaconBlock` by replacing the `body_root` with `body` that merkleize to the same `body_root`

- Performance Considerations
  - Loading full beacon state into zkVM is impractical due to size
  - Recomputing the entire merkleization for each state change is inefficient
  - Justin's suggestion: Load state initially, then track SSZ encoding and Merkle tree
  - Only update parts of the Merkle tree that change, not the entire tree
  - Lighthouse client already implemented tree-based state storage with partial updates

## Team Updates

- Partha: Reviewing code from Jun and Unnawut, studying partial SSZ spec

- Jun:
  - Implementing STFs with Kayden, Varun, and Kolby
  - Working on state transitions for the zkVM
  - Added integration of BLS backend from ZK crypto (written in 100% Rust)
  - SP1 now supports precompiles for this library

- Kayden:
  - Implementing process execution function and consensus functions
  - Implemented a few JSON RPC calls
  - Working on the `is_valid_block_hash` functions
  - Currently implementing notify new payload function from Deneb spec

- Unnawut:
  - Adding Pico zkVM to succint's benchmark suite
  - Exploring partial state writes and SSZ partials
  - Proposed two benchmarking approaches:
    1. Benchmark against consensus spec test data
    2. Create a CL layer equivalent of [ETHProofs](https://ethproofs.org/) (proving time constraints may require scoping down functions)

- Kolby:
  - Fixed bug in compute shuffled index implementation
  - Reviewing PRs from team members
  - Working on peer-to-peer layer and request-response domain

## Discussion on Winternits XMSS for Validator Identification

- Justin's explanation:
  - Winternet-based XMSS uses a Merkle tree of Winternet leaves
  - Root of public keys serves as master public key and validator identifier
  - Format differs from current BLS keys (32 bytes vs 96 bytes)
  - Keys have a maximum lifetime (potentially a century)
  - Validators generate keys for their expected staking period

## zkVM State Transition Discussion

- Approach to State Transitions:
  - Calculate state transition before executing in zkVM
  - Pass only state changes to the zkVM
  - All validation and computation must happen in zkVM for security
  - Only relevant Merkle paths are loaded, not the entire state
  - State reads/writes and comparison logic run in zkVM
  - Aim to minimize zkVM operations for speed, especially with SNARK-friendly hash functions

## Action Items

- Unnawut: Continue benchmarking with Pico zkVM and work on zkSTF with SSZ partials
- Jun: Manage implementation of consensus spec test operations for ZKVM
- Kayden: Continue work on process execution function
- Kolby: Continue work on p2p layer and Req/Resp domain
- Partha: Continue reviewing code and understanding how the system works
