# Ream Meeting #26 Recap

## Overview

The team made significant progress across multiple fronts this week, with key developments in P2P networking, validator functionality, and Beam chain preparation. Several developers focused on debugging and refining core networking components, while others advanced validator endpoints and began implementing Beam-specific features. The team also discussed strategies for managing Beam-specific functionality within the existing Beacon chain codebase, with a consensus to keep features in the main branch for now given their minimal scope.

## Development Progress

### Peer-to-Peer Networking

- **Request-Response Protocol**: Kolby fixed critical issues with outbound transfer handling and state management, preventing crashes when handling messages without proper state
- **Status Request Implementation**: Kolby implemented outbound status requests that are now working between Ream instances, with inbound response handling currently being debugged
- **Gossip Message Integration**: Kayden completed the connection between P2P gossip messages and the network manager, adding fork choice functions and working on correct subnet ID implementation

### Validator Implementation

- **Beacon API Endpoints**: Shariq implemented most validator endpoints required for block proposals and attestations, with only block publishing and aggregated attestation endpoints remaining
- **Validator Flow Logic**: Patchoulis connected attestation duties and implemented slot/epoch timing mechanisms, successfully testing with public Beacon node APIs, currently working on sync committee logic
- **Validator Timing**: Patchoulis verified proper slot clock and epoch clock functionality through testing with external Beacon nodes

### Client implementation

- **Voluntary Exits**: Vid implemented operation pools for voluntary exits as part of Beacon API endpoints, designed for temporary storage until block finalization
- **MEV-Boost Integration**: Varun completed research on integrating MEV-Boost support into Ream, preparing to open an initial PR

### Beam Chain Features

- **Account Manager**: Partha submitted a PR for the skeletal account manager command to generate OTS keys, with 2^28 lifetime taking approximately 5 hours to generate on M2 Mac hardware

### zkVM

- **64-bit List**: Unnawut continues to work a potential solution by modifying SSZ types through a single function change (`tree_hash_root()`), planning to complete this week before moving to the main Ream codebase

### Miscellaneous

- **Website Launch**: Unnawut successfully launched the project website at https://reamlabs.com

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Complete 64-bit SSZ type modification fix and transition to main Ream codebase development
- **Kolby**: Debug and fix inbound status response handling, then merge P2P connection PR and implement forward sync functionality
- **Kayden**: Finish subnet ID implementation PR for gossip topics
- **Shariq**: Complete remaining validator endpoints (block publishing and aggregated attestation) and begin validator flow implementation
- **Patchy**: Complete sync committee logic for validator and address Beam chain constant modifications for increased validator support
- **Partha**: Address PR review feedback for account manager, implement variable lifetime options for OTS keys, and create reputation management PR
- **Varun**: Open initial PR for MEV-Boost integration support
- **Vid**: Update operation pools PR based on review comments
