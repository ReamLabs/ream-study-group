# Ream Meeting #25 Recap

## Overview

The team held a productive weekly status update call with strong participation from multiple contributors. The main focus areas included ongoing work on the 64-bit compatibility problem, P2P networking improvements, validator implementation progress, and various Beacon API endpoints. Several team members are making significant strides toward completing core functionality, with the validator client nearing completion and networking components being actively refined.

## Development Progress

### 64-bit Compatibility
- Unnawut continued work on the 64-bit problem, exploring 4 different solution options with Jun's input
  - Option 1: Fork type num and hash libraries to append zeros after 32-bit length
  - Option 2: Override SSZ types to handle hardware directly (attempted but failed due to type constraints)
  - Option 3: Use 64-bit system like ZisK (not yet started)
  - Option 4: Cap beacon state to 32-bit (non-conformant but functional)
- Currently pursuing Option 1 with magic detection for 32-bit length lists
- Jun also explored 64-bit issue solutions but will have limited availability for upcoming weeks due to semester commitments
- Vid suggested exploring EIP-7916 Progressive List as potential solution for SSZ container types. It will break beacon specs but still on par with Option 4.

### P2P Networking & Syncing
- Kolby implemented database reading and apply request handling
  - Added peer pinging on intervals and improved peer connection logic to only connect peers on the same network
  - Currently debugging request handler crash issues and stream object timing problems
  - Working on proper status message implementation for network compatibility checks
- Partha addressed review comments on peer management PR
- Varun completed weak subjectivity checks implementation in Ream

### Engine APIs & Network Manager
- Kayden implemented and tested 9 engine APIs with all PRs working
  - Currently connecting P2P gossip messages to the network manager
  - Adding on functions for implemented APIs
  - Collaborating with Kolby on related networking improvements

### Keystore & Validator Client
- Shariq completed all validator functions outlined by consensus specs
  - Finished two duty fetching endpoints for both beacon node and validator
  - Completed validator startup endpoints - validator should be ready to start soon
- Patchy finished keystore decryption functionality for importing keystores
  - Connected attestation duties and events endpoints to validator
  - Implemented slot clock PR for epoch task scheduling
- Partha is working on key generation utility tool to replace existing validator setup
  - Working on documentation for required changes

## Next Steps

- **Unnawut**: Continue 64-bit problem resolution focusing on Option 1 implementation and launch new website
- **Kolby**: Fix request handler crash bug and stream object timing issues while completing peer network compatibility verification
- **Kayden**: Finish connecting P2P gossip messages to network manager and complete implementation of on functions for engine APIs
- **Varun**: Continue with additional consensus-related improvements
- **Shariq**: Finalize remaining Beacon API endpoints for validator
- **Partha**: Complete peer management PR based on review feedback and finish key generation utility tool with documentation
- **Patchy**: Test validator on testnets to confirm 32 ETH startup requirements and complete final validator client components
- **Jun**: Limited availability due to semester commitments
- **Vid**: Create issue in consensus repository for EIP-7916 Progressive list investigation and begin work on Beacon Pool attestations endpoint
- **Mercy**: Complete committee subscription implementation and address final review comments
